QUEST_LV_0300_20150323_000005	The seals in the village are supposed to be sealed - that's why they're called seals, {nl}so what's the big deal? The priests are just trying to scare us for no reason.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150323_000006	The priests don't want everyone to know how important the seals in the village are.{nl}They think that they can just take the burden upon themselves, {nl}and then everything will be alright.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000083	It looks like you're going to have to listen to Svitrigaila's story.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000084	Gather Poisonous Weeds
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000085	Svitrigaila tells you that, as a Revelator, it wouldn't be bad for you to help him commit suicide, and he asks you to gather some poisonous herbs for him.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000091	You gave Svitrigaila the poisonous herbs, and it appears that he ate them, but you don't see any change in him. Try speaking to him again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000092	Seeing as there was no effect on Svitrigaila when he ate the poisonous herbs, it must be that he needs to mix them with holy water first, and then eat them to get the desired result. Find the Cleric Master and get the holy water from him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000093	Destroy the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000094	Talk with Svitrigaila some more.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000102	According to Svitrigaila, you need to amplify the power of the explosive powder in order to destroy the next terminal, and for that, you'll need to scrape off and collect particles from petrified objects in this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000103	Blow up the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000104	Use the explosive powder Svitrigaila gave you and the petrification particles you collected to blow up the second terminal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000105	Ask Svitrigaila what you need to do to destroy the next terminal.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000106	Destroy the Terminal
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000107	Svitrigaila says that the third terminal will get knocked out if anything comes near it. Retrieve the core from the petrified monsters nearby and throw it at the terminal to destroy it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000108	And Eternal Repose
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000109	Now that you've gotten rid of all the terminals, return to Svitrigaila.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000112	Destroy the Soul Compactor
QUEST_LV_0300_20150717_000113	You have crafted Svitrigaila's Orb. Now take the orb to the Soul Compactor.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000121	Who cares what happens to this body that I can't move, or even escape from.{nl}I just want to rest a little.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000122	You just need to gather the poisonous weeds from the area above us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000123	That area's known for its Bluebane...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000124	Thank you. Let me try eating these one by one...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000125	Just as I feared... I'm still here.{nl}I heard the Cleric Master has holy water that, when mixed with Bluebane, {nl}can easily kill any demon.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000127	Have a safe journey to Klaipeda.

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000129	Are you helping a demon?{nl}I won't pry into your personal affairs, but as a master serving the goddess, {nl}I cannot get involved in this. Please leave this place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000130	I will never involve myself in a demon's work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000131	I see... I should have expected that...{nl}I was a fool to hope otherwise.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000132	If it comes down this, I guess I'll have to try that method now.{nl}Destroying the Soul Compactor that's here... The beings that sent me here told me.{nl}The Soul Compactor and I are one and the same. Why didn't I remember this until now?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000133	Somewhere in this area is a Soul Compactor that absorbs human souls.{nl}It condenses their energy and uses it.{nl}This is a really suitable location for the Soul Compactor because, {nl}even after the Petrifying Frost blew through, it's still bustling with the activity of the {nl}Knights of Kaliss, grave robbers, and the soldiers of the Royal Army.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000134	{nl}{nl}If I think about it, the beings that sent me here must have linked my life with the Soul Compactor so that I could collect souls for them forever. So if the Soul Compactor is destroyed, wouldn't I die with it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000135	The Soul Compactor has 3 terminals from which it absorbs souls.{nl}That bad feeling you had earlier was also a terminal trying to absorb your soul.{nl}For now, try to wipe out those terminals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000136	{nl}If you succeed in destroying a terminal, you should be able to retrieve its core.{nl}You need to collect those cores to craft an orb that will help you destroy the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000137	Good job. This core will be used to make an orb that will overload the mainframe of the Soul Compactor.{nl}Now I can feel my death drawing near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000138	Try blowing up the second terminal.{nl}Here, I'll give you some explosives, but you'll need to scrape off some particles from petrified{nl}objects in this area to amplify the power of the explosives.{nl}Since the Petrifying Frost blows through here often, there are plenty of petrified objects {nl}everywhere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000139	Again, you'll need to retrieve the core from this terminal too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000140	Now there's only one terminal left.. I feel myself getting weaker...{nl}The last terminal is probably short-circuiting.{nl}Try getting cores from petrified monsters in the area and throwing them at the terminal.{nl}That should be enough to make it collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000141	And of course, bring back the core from the last terminal.{nl}Condensed souls are concentrated within those cores... {nl}We just need to use them to craft an orb that will overload the Soul Compactor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000142	Now you've collected them all. Here, I'll give you the manual.{nl}Use this to craft the orb to overload the Soul Compactor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000143	I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000144	Is this the last time? Really.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000145	Let's see if we have all the detonators.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000146	You've come... but it's already time for me to go.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000147	I feel drained.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000148	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000149	Notice/!/When you touch the device, it feels like your soul is being drained!{nl}You must find someone who can fix this situation!
QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000150	I'll cooperate

QUEST_LV_0300_20150729_000156	Craft %s
QUEST_LV_0300_20150730_000157	As I expected, we have to get the Terminal Core again.{nl}Hmm... I'll cast a protection spell on you so the terminal won't defeat you like before.{nl}I have enough strength left for that, at least.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150730_000158	I guide petrified souls in accordance with the will of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150730_000159	The Petrifying Frost will blow here soon. But we don't know when...{nl}I wonder if the Petrification Detector is working properly at Supply Route.{nl}Could you please check it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150730_000160	Craft %s
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000161	They might get killed since there's no word from them.{nl}If you find their bodies... please bring them with their mementos.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000162	Entire troops were killed. Thank you for the help.{nl}There should be a part in the mementos.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000163	You need to move on to repair.{nl}Be careful of the Petrifying Frost.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000164	Holy water?{nl}What do you need it for?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000165	There is a demon who needs holy water at Dingofasil District?{nl}...
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000166	I won't concern myself with your personal matters, but I can't help demons as a cleric.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000167	Maybe this is the only way...{nl}Destroying the Spirit Integration Device...{nl}The ones who sent me here told me that the Spirit Integration Device and I are one. {nl}{nl}How could I forget that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000168	The Spirit Integration Device absorbs souls from 3 terminals.{nl}The curse from a while ago was the process to absorb souls.{nl}Let's destroy the terminals one by one.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000169	Then bring the core.{nl}Oh, I'll cast a spell on you so you won't be cursed again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000170	We should destroy the second terminal. {nl}I will give you some bombs, but to amplify the effects of the bombs, {nl}you will need some petrified water powder.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000171	We should get the core of the terminal this time as well.{nl}Hmm... the spell has been released so that we won't get hurt by the spell. I will lock it again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20150803_000172	Here it is.{nl}The broken detector can be easily fixed with these parts.{nl}If the parts don't stay in place very well, get some strings from the nearby monsters and {nl}use them.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000212	Revelator! Are you okay?{nl}The Petrifying Frost, it's really dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000213	I am guiding the spirits that suffered from the Petrifying Frost long ago.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000214	But the Petrifying Frost is the curse of the Demon Queen Gesti...{nl}It make us Kupoles turn into stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000215	We should at least find out when the Petrifying Frost will blow.{nl}There are some petrification detectors which humans left behind, but some seem to be broken.{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000216	The detector you saw seems to be working well.{nl}Please look at how the other detectors are working.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000217	The Petrifying Frost turns everything into stone. Even spirits.{nl}We, Kupoles, are no exception.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000218	Ah, that's it.{nl}Two of them are broken.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000219	We better ask about the soldiers who created the detectors about them.{nl}I heard the person named Retia is the officer so we may receive some help from her.  
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000220	He is at Verkti Square.{nl}Human matters cannot be resolved by the Kupoles, so we are counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000221	Are you talking about the petrification detector at the Coastal Fortress?{nl}We are already aware of that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000222	It hasn't arrived yet? {nl}I've already dispatched the soldiers there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000223	I don't have a good feeling about this.{nl}Due to numerous monster attacks here, we don't have additional forces to send.{nl}Can I ask you to follow the guards who were dispatched for the repair?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000224	Maybe they have been attacked at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}But, they are the guards of the kingdom. Their dead bodies should be brought here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000225	The Petrifying Frost is reported frequently at the entrance of the Coastal Fortress,{nl}so I think they will be around there. In case you find some corpses, please collect them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000226	I guess it was too late. Thanks for collecting the corpses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000227	Please come back after fixing the petrification detector.{nl}I have something to say.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000228	I am counting on you to guide all the spirits to the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000229	Lastly, there's some story that they want to tell to the Revelator.{nl}You will want to know why humans are suffering from this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000230	The rumor that the Petrifying Frost is the sin of the revolt is just a made-up story.{nl}The curse came after the revolt so they may well think so.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000231	No, however. {nl}Everything was their plot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000232	The ones who broke it first were the demons, however.{nl}That's the Petrifying Frost... they died and their spirits have become stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000233	Demon Queen Gesti brought the curse of the petrification on this land,{nl}and the goddesses tried to save the humans. But, the demons asked us whether {nl}we had forgotten not to interfere with each other's matters and...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000234	Wait. This memory is too horrible..{nl}A horrible catastrophe has landed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000235	Like a big disaster that the goddess might abandon to save this petrified place.{nl}The Petrifying Frost... All of that... This is what we must suffer through to save that which {nl}we abandoned.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000236	I will try to save the spirits from now on.{nl}Since you fixed all the detectors, we will be able to guide the spirits to eternal sleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000237	We will do our best to guide each and every one of them.{nl}I hope the goddesses bless you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000238	I guess you can't trust me since a demon like me is asking you a favor.{nl}But, look at me closely. It doesn't matter if you laugh at me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000239	I've tried my best to escape for hundreds of years.{nl}But, the curse of the petrification is the power of the Demon Queen. {nl}This endless depression is suffocating me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000240	Even if you escape, you're still a traitor.{nl}You'll be called a "traitor" while at the feet of the colleagues who mocked you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000241	If you cooperate towards my death, I will definitely remove your curse.{nl}I promise in the name of Giltine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000242	It doesn't matter what happens to my body.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000243	The poisonous plant that grows up there would be able to take my life away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000244	I will pray that a plant that is poisonous to humans brings me eternal rest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000245	Thanks. Now, I will pray for the end of my agonizing life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000246	So nothing occurs as I expected.{nl}If that's the case... We can't say we are in distress. We just have to rely on the one{nl}that we demons want to eliminate.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000247	Please bring the holy water from the one who follows the call of the goddesses.{nl}That sacred power will lead me to death.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000248	I heard the Cleric Master handles the holy water.{nl}I don't know if he's going to give me any.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000249	Are you talking about holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but may I ask you where you are going to use it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000250	There are demons who need the holy water?{nl}I am sorry, but I can't help you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000251	I am not going to be involved in your personal matter.{nl}No matter what the reasons are, I can't help a demons' matters as a priest.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000252	As a priest, I can't cooperate on the tasks of the demons.{nl}I hope you understand this as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000253	So... that's it.{nl}Maybe, we came to expect something that we shouldn't expect.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000254	The people who I believed to be my colleagues betrayed me. {nl}Then, there is no reason for me to hold on to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000255	The demon lord has ordered me to collect the spirits of humans that will be dedicated to the god.{nl}That's why we began working on creating the integrator which would collect the spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000256	The process was smooth, but I suffered from the curse of the Petrifying Frost.{nl}Frozen freak, they said while laughing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000257	That I will be the soure of magic of the integrator.{nl}How did I come to forget this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000258	You must know by now.{nl}The curse that has been put on the barrier stone... we use it to pull spirits from humans.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000259	The spirits that were pulled will be gathered to the integrator and dedicated to the god.{nl}The god... it is like me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000260	The integrator is being protected by three barrier stones.{nl}Destroy the barrier stones down there and obtain the cores from them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000261	I will cast a spell on you so that you won't get cursed again.{nl}The integrator moves by consuming my vitality so it's easy for me. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000262	The guys who abandoned me and laughed at me can't be called our colleagues.{nl}I will get my revenge by killing them. I will make them regret that they treated me {nl}like a source of magic.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000263	Well done. My death is near.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000264	The next barrier stone is up there. {nl}We have to put in great power all at once. Like an explosion.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000265	Okay... there was a grave robber among the ones who were sacrificed.{nl}I tried to lead myself into death using a bomb, but it was useless.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000266	We should not forget about the core of the barrier stone.{nl}To avoid being cursed again, I will cast a spell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000267	How come I never thought about this.{nl}Maybe my loyalty has surpassed the fear of loneliness.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000268	The last barrier stone must be exploding by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000269	As the monsters were being petrified, their last breaths were also solidified... {nl}Throw those against barrier stones.{nl}They will gradually collapse.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000270	The core of the barrier stone is composed of condensed spirits.{nl}We will make orbs by collecting those that would destroy the integrator.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000271	I will put the last of my power into the cores of the barrier stones which you've collected.{nl}Pull out monsters' detonators with this and make an orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000272	Of course, I will give you a method to make the orb.{nl}The orb that would destroy the integrator.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000273	And, please fulfill my last wish.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000274	I've handed over the method to make the orb with my power.{nl}It will be easy to make an orb.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000275	Succeeded...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000276	Do you know the meaning of the name Giltine?{nl}Her name means death. The only thing that I can rely on at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000277	I once thought that I didn't care what I turn myself into if it was for the demons long ago.{nl}But, only the Petrifying Frost blew to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000278	I started to slowly harden over hundreds of years.{nl}My name has been erased from everyone's minds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000279	Even if she doesn't bring me eternal rest, it will be better than now.{nl}I just want to rest...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000280	Death is coming to me.{nl}I feel good.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000281	Yes. That's it. Give it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000282	Within the keepsakes you've found for me...{nl}There must be some parts that will fix the detector at the Coastal Fortress.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000283	Here it is. {nl}The repair shouldn't be that hard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000284	The Royal Army was taught that they should be loyal and honorable to the kingdom.{nl}And to be committed to due diligence when engaging in their duties.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000285	You came back a long way.{nl}So these are the parts to fix the petrification detector.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000286	It must have been hard to obtain the parts, but the repair itself shouldn't be that hard.{nl}Let's return.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000287	Pillar
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000288	(It seems like something is written on the pillar.)

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000291	{nl}You can obtain the piece of the symbol somewhere in Galeed Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000292	(Something is written, but is not legible.)
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000293	(It seems that something is written on it, but it can't be read in this condition.)

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000301	I feel like I age a hundred years whenever I deal with Pardoners.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000306	We better do our duty fast...{nl}We just have to hang tight a little longer...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000307	I am not sure how to return to the army.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000310	We are going to freeze to death instead of dying from hunger.{nl}Are there any better options?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000311	Thank you so much for saving me last time.{nl}I want to help you, but I am tied to the army...

QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000324	I won't have any strength to fight by just eating meat.{nl}Everyone knows it's important to eat a variety of food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000325	Since this place is colder than other areas, it is important to consume nutritious food.{nl}As a supply officer, I am having a hard time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000326	An outsider is better at going down the mountains.{nl}You will either freeze to death or die from hunger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000327	Although the kingdom has become famous, we are still soldiers.{nl}This is a military zone. Please leave you are not an official.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000328	I heard that this place was used as a workshop.{nl}We are able to find old materials easily, but the problem is the food shortage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151001_000329	I am worried since the number of my men who are running away is increasing.{nl}Our supplies will last longer, but I am worried that I may become the only one left.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000565	It's good that the merchants are coming out to the world, {nl}but I am not sure if they would be able to keep their lives.{nl}But, even so, we are not doing something that we are not familiar with so it doesn't matter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000566	The kingdom hasn't been fallen to the demons yet.{nl}If we do our best, we will find peace again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000567	The rest of the work is in Orsha.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000569	That's not us, and I am sure there isn't such name in Anastoses.{nl}Though, who is Albinas anyways?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000570	She is so disgraceful. The woman named Albinas...{nl}I don't know why she broke the tombstone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000571	We were making a tombstone that would help the goddesses.{nl}We are going to collect the sacred energy and {nl}send it to the goddesses through the tombstone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000572	We're going to collapse easily if we don't have something to rely on.{nl}That's why the belief of the goddesses is more important.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000573	I don't have any energy.{nl}I am investigating about the differences in views between Nestoses and Anastoses... {nl}I miss my research room.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000574	There is only one belief, but the views can be diverse.{nl}Like Nestoses and Anastoses there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000575	Even so, this won't cause a big difference or an argument.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000581	I've heard that the demons are impersonating Anastoses.{nl}But, we are not going to argue for such matters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000582	We Anastoses are focusing more on the realities than Nestoses.{nl}We can't just do nothing while waiting for the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000583	However we all serve the goddesses and focus on our faith.{nl}That's why we are on our pilgrimage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000584	It was so scary when Albinas turned into a Fire Lord and started to attack me.{nl}Thank you so much for helping us returning to the camp.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151022_000670	That is so amazing that you managed to defeat the Demon Lord!{nl}Because of you, the ferrets won't steal our food anymore.{nl}Thank you.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000684	Of course I won!{nl}However, I said I dropped the necklace I recieved as evidence from the guy into the sea.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000685	Back then, I gave up because the sea was too deep...{nl}Even now I'm not sure if I can still find it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000686	If I can find it, I think I will be able to deal a blow to those who says I am a bluff.{nl}It's near Kranto Coast. I recognized you as a Corsair, so you should be able to find it quickly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000687	A Centurion knows how to dedicate himself for the kingdom...{nl}He should know its honor.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000688	I am looking for the flags of a few soldiers who were annihilated on Medzio Diena.{nl}I want you to help me with this, for the honor of these soldiers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000689	I've heard that there were soldiers who lost contact at the Drill Ground of Confliction{nl}on Medzio Diena. We didn't expect them to be alive though...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000690	At least we will be able to remember the dedicated loyalty the army had towards the kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000691	If you are a Doppelsoeldner, there is a task that you should do for the kingdom.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000692	I want to do it myself, but I'm doing some quiet work. {nl}I will be spotted easily.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000693	I appreciate you telling me that. {nl}Please look for Commander Ramin's delegate secretly. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000694	The last contact we had was receieved from Fasika Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000695	That's so unfortunate. They've probably been attacked by the demons.{nl}Anyways, you have all of my support now that you've {nl}become a valuable member of the Doppelsoeldners.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000696	Ah, please keep this a secret from the others.{nl}I will find another way to contact General Ramin.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000700	Ah, you've arrived at a good time.{nl}I am investigating the Crystal Mine, but the toxic gas is leaking out again.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000702	First, I need you to get me the materials so we can prepare it.{nl}I'll write down the necessary materials and where you cand find them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000703	This will be enough.{nl}We were able to finish this quickly because of your help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000704	It will take some time before we can extract the substances...{nl}In the meantime, I will teach you alchemy.

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000706	To prove your skills as a Rogue...{nl}I have an idea that will also solve my problem.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000707	The Scout Master and I used be the best friends.{nl}However, our relationship now is not as close as it used to be.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000708	In an effort to become closer, I want to give him a present...{nl}I want to give something that the Scout Master likes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000709	Are you prepared for what I am going to request of you?

QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000711	However, what if the monsters die...{nl}Unfavorable scents may get mixed unless you pull them out when they are alive.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000712	To give you a little hint, this is something you do behind their backs.{nl}Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000713	You've collected enough of them as expected.{nl}By fulfilling this request, I can tell that you won't have a problem learning the last skill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000714	There are many people who have the same level of competence as you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000715	Well, alright.{nl}Though, you need to understand that this will be very difficult for you {nl}if you want to learn this at your current level.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000716	I've been searching for the arrows that the first Fletcher Master created a long time ago.{nl}Those arrows were given to Lydia Schaffen as a present.{nl}I think they contain some sort of advanced technology.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000717	Recently, I've obtained useful information about the whereabouts of those arrows...{nl}There is a person who is able to identify the true value of those arrows.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000718	I've heard they were at Galeed Plateau.{nl}However, they were used when facing some violent monster, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000719	Oh. I've only seen it for a short period of time, but I can tell how amazing it is.{nl}I want to do some research on this arrow immediately, {nl}but I've made a promise with you, so that's the first thing I'm going to do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000720	Okay... Let's get started.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000721	As a Falconer Master, I am always looking at different options to make Falconers stronger.{nl}Recently, I've been thinking how I can make those flying monsters of use to us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000722	Of course I am satisfied with my partner, Rith..{nl}I think these attempts are helpful to Falconers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000723	When we tame a hawk, maybe we should feed it something?{nl}I don't have high expectations, but we better go there and try it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000724	I've placed some food for you to try it on at least three different types of monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000725	Did we fail... {nl}I expected it though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000726	Regardless of the result, I should reward you for your effort.{nl}The biggest reward I can give to you would be teaching you new skills.{nl}What do you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000727	Shoot at an enemy and hit it...{nl}That's one of the basics of a Schwarzer Reiter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000728	So you want to learn new skills, huh? {nl}Hitting an enemy with our eyes closed? How does that sound?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000729	Hahaha. However, we aren't blind. {nl}We shouldn't go that far, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000730	I'm liking your confidence!{nl}I like it so much that we're going to put it to the test.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000731	Your objective is to accurately hit the targets multiple times.{nl}If you're able to do that, I will acknowledge your skills.{nl}So... I'd say about 200 times? Personally I think thats quite easy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000732	I knew it wasn't a bluff! It was the confidence, am I right?!{nl}As promised, I will gladly become your teacher.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000733	The way of a true Monk...{nl}One should push oneself to extreme limits and endure the harsh training.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000734	If you are willing to take the challenge, then we will start immediately.{nl}Talk to me once you are ready for it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000735	If I were you I'd hurry up.{nl}If you don't defeat enough enemies within the time limit, we'll start from the beginning again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000736	Very good.{nl}Now is the time for you to learn something from me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000737	I know that you are ready to be a good Pardoner...{nl}But I'm kind of in big trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000738	Well, those impious monsters ripped apart the book of offerings.{nl}Because of that, I can't proceed with my other tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000739	I will tell you the location if you can get me that first book.{nl}I think of you as a trustworthy person since we are close...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000740	The first book is at Elkosh Abbey Hospital.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000741	In order to prevent someone from taking them, I've hidden them in the books...{nl}And I've prepared several fake books, so I want you to find them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000742	This is the right place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000743	Welcome.{nl}I am looking for someone who is willing to help me with my research.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000744	Four years have passed after Medzio Diena...{nl}The aftermath of this disaster hasn't gone down at all, instead it's grown larger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000745	Especially the plants that have grown so big turned into monsters and dealt a lot of damage.{nl}I am continuously doing research to resolve this issue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000746	If you can help me with my research, I will teach you the next level of the Druid.{nl}I believe this will be an adequate assignment for you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000747	Please get me samples from the plants who have turned into monsters.{nl}You can obtain more samples the stronger the monster is.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000748	I know that my request was not easy to complete, but you've done it!{nl}These samples that you've brought are excellent and helpful in my research.{nl}As promised, I will help you since you helped me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000749	I know what business you have with me...{nl}That aside, we have something more important going on right now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000750	Suddenly, the evil energy has become stronger in the place I used to look {nl}at using divine power. Using Clairvoyance doesn't even work anymore for me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000751	I'm asking you if you could get rid of the evil energy that's lurking there?{nl}If you do, I promise you that I will help you reach the next level.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000752	The location is Galeed Plateau.{nl}Please put the Purification of Namott that I gave you to the area {nl}where the evil energy is strong. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000753	I knew you were the right person to do this.{nl}As promised, I will lead you to the next level of the Oracle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000754	Good. Let's get started right away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000755	You need to fight the monsters until the time limit expires.{nl}As you defeat stronger monsters, I will acknowledge that you've went through hard training..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000756	If you don't defeat them within the time limit, you start from scratch. {nl}Be cautious.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000757	Dragoon Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000758	A Dragoon should never move too far away from an enemy when in danger.{nl}The Dragoon needs to have the courage to fight harder, better, faster, and stronger.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000759	We reject the courage of those who fight without skills.{nl}The path of the Dragoon is a difficult path.{nl}So if you've come here without a strong sense of determination, I suggest you leave now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000760	Alright, let's see if you really are worthy enough to become one of us.{nl}Show me your skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000761	Your objective is to battle monsters and embrace the pain. Do not move away from them.{nl}That's the determination of a courageous Dragoon. {nl}So, attack and defeat the monsters even if you take damage from them. {nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000762	What's this? We don't want anyone with a careless mind.{nl}Since I like you, I am giving you another chance. {nl}Come on, show me your courage and your skills!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000763	Excellent. You did good.{nl}From this day forward, I will acknowledge you as a member of the Dragoons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000764	Are you interested in becoming a Templar?{nl}I can already tell that you're very smart for making this choice.{nl}Now, let me give you a walkthrough of what you need to be aware of.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000765	A Templar is a leader to many people. We need people with strong leadership skills.{nl}Especially during these times, a Templar's leadership is the most likely required.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000766	Don't get me wrong, though. This is often misunderstood as 'authority'.{nl}No, I'm leaning more towards 'cooperation'.{nl}You should cooperate with your followers in order to maintain a group.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000767	Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?{nl}With that being said, let's see your skills as a Templar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000768	A person in authority makes orders, but a Templar should make requests.{nl}Your task is to recruit five people and become their leader in that group.{nl}While being the leader of the group, you have to lead them for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000769	The fuel that drives people is the respect.{nl}So, to confirm if you possess this charm, I will put you up to the test.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000770	Oh, I absolutely do not like to be deceived by tricks or anything like that.{nl}Recruit five people all by yourself and become the leader of the group.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000771	Well done.{nl}You are certainly much more charming than I expected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000772	It can be tough to make other people follow you.{nl}The more people following you, the tougher it becomes.{nl}It's not easy, but a Templar with great respect and admiration can pull it off.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000773	I will tell you the things that a Templar must have knowledge in.{nl}I hope you will make wise and careful decisions in the future, so do not forget this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000774	Warlock Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000775	We will take any measures by any means for the goddesses...{nl}That is the strict rule that we, Warlocks, must abide by.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000776	There are many people who misunderstand our interpretations.{nl}A Warlock and its evil spirits are not equally contracted.{nl}We have to rule over them and able to control the evil spirits.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000777	In order to do so, you need to possess strong magic able to rule and control the evil spirits.{nl}Unless... you want to end up consumed by them. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000778	Since you don't know these evil spirits as well as I do...{nl}I will give you a scroll that will wake them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000779	Use this scroll on monsters at Valius' Eternal Resting Place{nl}to wake up the sleeping evil spirits.{nl}To add another part of this challenge, you need to defeat a monster and the evil spirits.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000780	Get rid of the poison with poison. {nl}Anything else that is evil should be gotten rid of by the evil spirits. {nl}I am waiting for the day when we, the Warlocks, are not needed anymore.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000781	Excellent.{nl}This is much better than I had expected.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000782	From now on, you will tread the path of the Warlock. {nl}Oh, and please remember this...{nl}If you don't stand on top of them, you will be consumed by them...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000783	Featherfoot Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000784	I don't know how you found out about the curse of the Featherfoot, but...{nl}This curse should not be overused. Rather, it needs some detailed calculations.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000785	Of course, I can teach you if you still want to. However...
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000786	Since you don't know anything about the curse, I ask you to take these incantation tools.{nl}I told you that it requires detailed calculations before using the curse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000787	Find out what there is to lose and what there is to gain...{nl}Use these incantation tools to cast the curse on a monster to find out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000788	If you learn something here, you will become a great Featherfoot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000789	The curse should not be overused, but instead it requires some detailed calculations.{nl}Experience what the magic used by a Featherfoot is like with help of the tools.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000790	Now, do you have a broader understanding of the Featherfoot's curse?{nl}You should not consider it like the curse that is used by Demon Lords like Naktis.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000791	The arrows of the curse shall only be used on the enemies of the goddesses.{nl}For us, that is our most important guideline. Please keep that in mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000792	Cannoneer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000793	You enrolled to become a Cannoneer? Good choice, hotshot.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000794	Listen up! The most important attribute of the Cannoneer is firepower, a lot of it!{nl}If a Cannoneer cannot distinguish between aerial attacks and ground attacks, {nl}he or she isn't a valuable asset to the team!{nl}Enemies that are flying in the air should only be attacked by aerial attacks,{nl}and enemies that are on the ground should only be attacked by ground attacks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000795	I figured you should know about this if you want to become a skilled Cannoneer, like me.{nl}What about it, hotshot? You interested?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000796	Good! Alright, hotshot. {nl}I can only assume that you will remember what I will teach you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000797	Do you have a paper and pen with you? Remember this.{nl}There are many types of enemies, but the ones that are flying in the air are all aerial-type.{nl}In contrast, the ones that are moving on the ground are considered a walking-type.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000798	Alright, face against monsters with both these types.{nl}You need to understand how each enemy moves and which attacks are effective.
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000799	The flying monsters are aerial-types and {nl}the ones that move on the ground are walking-types.{nl}Face against both types of monsters. Understood?
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000800	Good.{nl}Was this a good lesson? Am I a good teacher?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000801	Alrighty then! Theoretically, you should know all the logic about what I've taught you.{nl}It's time to put the theory into practice!{nl}The skills of a Cannoneer are not easy, so make sure to focus!
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000802	Musketeer Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20151224_000803	A Musketeer should know how to handle a rifle.{nl}Not many enemies can stand against simultaneous firing by well trained Musketeers.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000976	The only problem is that the research is being delayed by {nl}monster attacks that are becoming more frequent these days.{nl}I just had a bunch of research materials stolen by monsters as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000977	I was told that they are very important to his research... This is worrying.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000978	Could you really do that?{nl}Then... Could you retrieve the research material from the monsters at Angis Trail?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000979	The monsters around here are too fierce for me to handle.{nl}Just turn around and run if you happen to think they're too dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000980	Wow, you've actually retrieved all the materials!{nl}I knew you were kind, but I guess I underestimated your skills.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000981	Um... I know this may sound rude, but could you help me a bit more?{nl}It's a really simple task, but I can see myself getting robbed by monsters again...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000982	You just have to tidy up the research materials you've retrieved {nl}in the Tidying Chest at the Temporary Research Facility.{nl}I'm sure I can be at ease with someone of your skill doing it... Would it be too much to ask?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000983	Thank you so much!{nl}I'll give you the instruction manual so don't forget {nl}to check the last part before you start tidying up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000984	There is a strict order to tidying it...{nl}So, don't forget to read it thoroughly!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000985	Thank you so much.{nl}I'm glad I asked you for help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000986	It seems as if I am in a daze because of the monster attacks.{nl}I think I discarded invaluable research materials while I was tidying them up.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000987	The discarded documents should be gathered at Menka Knoll... Could you look for them?{nl}I can't manage to get there because of the increase in monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000988	I'm sure that you'll be able to find them if you take a close look at the {nl}discarded documents there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000989	The documents you need to find is the Research Material List for Alemeth Forest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000990	You can leave the rest of the documents behind.{nl}Please check carefully not to get them mixed up with anything else.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000991	Did you check them carefully?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000992	It seems like you've brought the correct documents.{nl}Go see Sarma after you give me the documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000993	I think he's kept an eye on your skills.{nl}I think he wants to ask you something after seeing you help me out.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000994	Sarma
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000995	Ah, greetings.{nl}I assume you've heard of me from Gatre.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000996	I've been keeping a close eye on you since you helped Gatre.{nl}At first I was merely curious of an outsider here, but you seem to be quite talented.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000997	As you may be well aware of, it is hard to do any research because of the monsters.{nl}I think I'll be able to finish my research if you help me out a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000998	It's for the wellbeing of the people here so I beg that you help out.{nl}Of course I shall pay handsomely when the research is finished.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_000999	I thank you.{nl}My first request is for you to gather the blood of Green Eldigos.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001000	I need to extract the blood from a live Green Eldigo for my research, but that's no easy task.{nl}I'll give you some Tranquilizer Powder to knock {nl}the Green Eldigos out and bring some blood back.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001001	So, how did it go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001002	Very good. Excellent.{nl}With the skills you've shown me, I think I can be confident in assigning you more tasks.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001003	I'll go to the Forest of Prayer Entrance and prepare for the final experiment.{nl}You can go and gather the ingredients needed for the last experiment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001004	Gatre has the list for the ingredients I need for the final experiment so you can get it from him.{nl}I have faith in you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001005	Sarma said that he needed all of the ingredients on the list?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001006	Oh no, it seems as if he's already beginning the final experiment!{nl}We have to find more evidence before it's too late.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001007	It would be strange to not collect the ingredients without proper evidence.{nl}Collect the listed ingredients since you can't risk him suspecting anything.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001008	Why don't we gather some evidence together since Sarma seems to be absent.{nl}I know just what to look for.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001009	There are research notes from a person that used to help Sarma's experiments.{nl}His name was Boldas... and is in a coma because of an unfortunate accident.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001010	Sarma had those notes until he lost them in a monster attack.{nl}Come to think of it, I think Sarma was especially nervous about losing those notes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001011	There may be important information in those notes.{nl}He lost the notes towards the Juice Collection Site, so try searching that area first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001012	Don't forget the listed ingredients either.{nl}I'll do what Sarma asked in order to avoid suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001013	Do you have all of the ingredients?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001014	Hmm. There seems to be something missing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001015	Ah! It seems that it's missing from the list.{nl}I thought I had written everything down, but mistakes where made...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001016	I'm sorry, but could you go get some fermented fruit tree sap from Gatre?{nl}I can't proceed with the experiment without it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001017	Sarma told you that he needed fermented fruit tree sap right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001018	He really has come close to finishing the experiments.{nl}You see, I had removed the sap from the list on purpose.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001019	By the way, how does Sarma's research seem to you?{nl}Did you find anything suspicious in the research notes?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001020	I think that's a good idea.{nl}We might be able to find some clues as to what Sarma is really up to.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001021	That was written in the notes?{nl}I'll need to take a look at the notes myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001022	Oh my...{nl}If these notes are true, then Sarma definitely has other plans for his research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001023	But the matter still stands that we don't have any actual proof.{nl}I'll look for some solid evidence if you can manage to stall the experiments for a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001024	Take something that is similar to the sap in order to ruin Sarma's experiment.{nl}Meanwhile, I'll check all of his research documents.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001025	I'll give you this tree sap.{nl}All you have to do is to go to the Research Material Warehouse {nl}and find something that looks similar to this.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001026	He has to mix all the ingredients before commencing the last stage anyways.{nl}So he won't be able to tell them apart as long as they look similar.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001027	Is this water from... near Pelke Shrine Ruins?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001028	I've heard that something bad happened there...{nl}Well, I suppose it will be alright.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001029	Take this to Sarma since they look almost identical at a glance.{nl}I'll take a peek at his research documents and try to find out his true purpose.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001030	Be careful just in case.{nl}I'll get to you as soon as I find something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001031	What took you so long in bringing me one more ingredient?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001032	Well, it seems as if you've brought the proper ingredient.{nl}This is the last stage of the experiment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001033	Now all that is left is to put this on the Transmutation Magic Circle and add magic.{nl}I've set it so that anyone can power it with magic, so you shouldn't have trouble. {nl}Now go and power the magic circle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001034	T-That's... because I have other things to do.{nl}I have to leave records of the experiment and observe the situation you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001035	Now stop stalling and go power up the Transmutation Magic Circle.{nl}All you have to do is put the ingredients on the circle {nl}and emancipate the magic from the tombstone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001036	But remember that the magic in the tombstone can only be emancipated from the front.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001037	Has the liquid properly been created?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001038	Ahah.{nl}It seems that I finally have results for this research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001039	Now all I have to do is check to see if the liquid has the intended effect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001040	Thanks to you, I've been able to get the research, which had been progressing slowly, this far.{nl}With this, we'll be able to restore the enlarged fruit trees back to normal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001041	How about you spray the liquid onto the trees yourself since you've helped me so far?{nl}If it has been properly made, it will make the trees go back to their original states.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001042	Here, I'll give you some of the liquid.{nl}We'll be able to see if it has any effect immediately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001043	Try spraying it on the Pile of Leaves just ahead of you.{nl}You'll be able to see something quite interesting.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001044	I'm sorry.{nl}I wasn't able to catch Sarma.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001045	Thankfully, the liquid wasn't created as Sarma planned.{nl}Even though he seems to think that it is perfect.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001046	Sarma's original plan was to create monsters that he could command.{nl}Thankfully, they don't seem to listen to him since we switched the ingredients a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001047	I'll go looking for Sarma.{nl}Even though the liquid is a failure, it's still quite dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001048	I hope that the hidden items will be found and used by whomever sees this inside the pot.{nl}There is another pot at the Old Camp that shows the location of the hidden items.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001049	Monster attacks have been too frequent lately.{nl}That's why Sarma's research is also being delayed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001050	Don't forget to read the last part of the instruction manual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001051	It will be hard to find the documents at Menka Knoll if you don't read them carefully.{nl}There's a lot of documents that are actually being disposed there as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001052	I've put my whole life's achievements on restoring Alemeth Forest to its original state.{nl}This research must succeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001053	Anyone would be upset about losing their notes.{nl}But Sarma... seemed to be much more than upset at the loss.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001054	The contents of those notes might prove to be important evidence.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001055	If you do get caught, just say that it was a simple mistake.{nl}The important thing is to buy us some more time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001056	First, help Sarma with his experiments.{nl}I'll try to find some evidence in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001057	The magic from the tombstone must be emancipated from the front.{nl}The front is the side with the letters on it, so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001058	It is finally time for my research to come to fruition...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001059	I had merely panicked a bit because of the sudden attack.{nl}I am not frightened of such monsters!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001060	I'm conducting research in order to restore the forest to its original state.{nl}Those fruits are inedible you see...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001061	It was hard getting a chance to talk to you because of Sarma.{nl}Now, I can tell you everything since he's gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001062	I can't believe he was researching how to control monsters...{nl}I'm having a hard time believing how a person could even {nl}think of doing so even after witnessing it with my two eyes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001063	They've all left because the fruits were inedible even though they were so large.{nl}But how could you turn your back on your hometown?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001064	What do you think the real purpose for Sarma's research is?{nl}I just hope that I'm worrying over nothing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001065	The villagers all believed in Sarma and his research...{nl}How could he do such a thing?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001066	You're an outsider that I haven't seen before.{nl}I don't know what you're doing here, but please don't interrupt my research.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001067	Everything is going as planned except for those monsters.{nl}They're hindering my research so much that it's become more than a mere nuisance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001068	I wish to show you the research once it's complete.{nl}Of course I will show it to Gatre who's been helping me all along as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001069	At last, the day that my research reaches fruition has come...{nl}It is a relief that I was able to receive help from someone as able as you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001070	Necromancer Lemija
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001071	Adomas is late...{nl}Where could he be?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001072	Where have Adomas and Faustas gone to when we have so much to do...{nl}Have you seen any Necromancers around here by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001073	It would have been hard even if we all worked together...{nl}But now, doing so is impossible.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001074	That Lord Lieutenant... He deserves to be attacked by monsters just like them.{nl}I'm only holding back because the mayor is too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001075	The goddesses are so merciless...{nl}I had only started to collect coral after giving up fishing for a living...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001076	I think everyone is shocked by the Lord Lieutenant.{nl}Well... At least I'm glad that things turned out alright in the end.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001077	Just look at them.{nl}They were attacked by monsters trying to gather tributes...{nl}It's just so wrong.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001078	I'll be fine as long as I get some proper rest thanks to the first aid.{nl}You've been a great help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001079	It's just pathetic.{nl}We don't even have basic amenities, but we're worrying about making tributes...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001080	That Lord Lieutenant will bring the wrath of the goddesses upon himself soon enough.{nl}He not only tried to get more tributes for himself, but also disgraced the lord.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001081	There is nothing more important to a merchant than credibility.{nl}I need to acquire the necessary coral in time... but it seems like I'm in trouble.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001082	I've heard. You've dealt with the terrifying monster that the Lord Lieutenant summoned.{nl}I wish that someone like you was in our merchant alliance.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001083	Don't stray too far from here if you can help it.{nl}The monster density increased so much that it's too dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001084	I never would've thought that my colleagues were also in league with the Lord Lieutenant...{nl}My head's still numb when I think of all those years we've served together.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001085	Please stay here where it's safe, if possible.{nl}There's no way for us to help if you stray too far away from here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001086	We're going to transport that Lord Lieutenant to the lord soon.{nl}I doubt that he'll get off easy...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001087	Please refrain from going too far away because there has been an increase of monsters.{nl}We won't be able to guarantee your safety due to our orders.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001088	An outsider helped out with something that we should have done ourselves...{nl}This is shameful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001089	Do you think I won't do anything after all of this humility? Wait and see. {nl}I'll show the merchant alliance and the refugees here who gets the last laugh some day!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001090	This guy, he still seem to be delusional.{nl}Does he really not know what situation he is in?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001091	It's all gone upside down because of that Lord Lieutenant and a few soldiers.{nl}I'm certain that they'll make inquiries into us as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001092	Merchant Alliance Worker
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001093	It was nice having a bit of a rest, but we weren't quite at ease either.{nl}I guess we can finally go to the customers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001094	I haven't been working here long, but that is a sight to behold.{nl}An ocean without any water... I've never seen anything like it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001095	I've heard that coral is really popular.{nl}I think it's said to be used in very expensive medicines... {nl}How much do you think it will cost?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001096	I guess anything can happen when the world is in such disarray.{nl}He's lucky the people here are gentle, he'd be thoroughly beaten if it was back where I'm from.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001097	What's going on?{nl}There are people willing to work and soldiers to protect them, {nl}yet we can't get the coral because of monsters?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001098	This used to be the bottom of the sea, but they say {nl}that all the water was drained after Medzio Diena.{nl}It's quite a sight don't you think?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001099	It's chilling to think that the Lord Lieutenant was the reason we weren't able to gather coral.{nl}I'm glad it's over now. All's well that ends well as they say.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001100	People like us have never even held a sword before, so all we can do is to envy your skills.{nl}Isn't it impressive that our leader found out that it {nl}was the Lord Lieutenant who was behind all of this?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001101	It's a shame about what happened to Faustas... But his crimes cannot be forgiven.{nl}He murdered... he murdered Adomas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001102	I'm planning on carrying out the rest of the mission.{nl}I'll have to tell the master about what happened... But I don't feel too comfortable.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001103	Search for the Monk
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001104	It seems as if returning to the annex is out of the question.{nl}Look for the monk that's trapped in the principal building.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001105	You have found a labeled reagent bottle in a pile of leaves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001106	Base reagent. Nahash Sample.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001110	Lucienne is missing!{nl}It seems as if she has gone to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land to use the reagent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001111	Searching past the Wall
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001112	It seems as if only Dominikas can pass through the black wall.{nl}Dominikas seems to be hiding something beyond the wall and lying about it.{nl}Search past the wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001113	Elgos Monk
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001114	I'm so... hungry...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001115	Starved
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001116	It seems as if there is nothing more to eat.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001117	Lucienne Winterspoon
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001118	Thank you so much for saving me!{nl}Whew, I was in a tight spot with my tent being attacked and all.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001120	Vaidotas. You know him right?{nl}Alchemist Master Vaidotas is my older cousin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001121	Have you heard that Vaidotas was kidnapped by the Vubbes?{nl}I mean, he's the Alchemist Master... {nl}I think I was more ashamed of the kidnapping than he was.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001122	That's why I've decided that I should take his place.{nl}Don't you think it's obvious that I'm more suitable for the position?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001123	The family elders are holding me back though.{nl}Would you believe that they're saying that they can't {nl}acknowledge my skill without distinct research results!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001124	That's why I came here.{nl}I'm trying to do some research on why the regions near Nahash Forest{nl}received less damage than other places on Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001125	But I've been unable to make much headway because there are so many monsters.{nl}It turns out that the only reason it was damaged less is because the bedrock is more solid.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001126	Then I discovered something amazing in Nahash Forest!{nl}There was an enormous plant rooted to the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001127	I thought it was perfect for my experiments because it wouldn't react to most substances.{nl}Think about it! Making a reagent that can get rid of such a large plant.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001128	I'll be able to restore damaged regions like Orsha or the Thorn Forest back to normal...{nl}It might even open a path to being able to prevent a second Medzio Diena from happening.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001129	Don't you think that the family elders will also acknowledge me as well?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001130	The problem is that the over abundant monster population is hindering my research.{nl}There should be less monsters if I could get to Pamesti Village...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001131	Of course. You seemed to be quite skilled back there...{nl}I'm sorry, but could you get me to Pamesti Village?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001132	I promise I won't forget you if you help me out this time after I become the Alchemist Master!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001133	Thanks! You've brought me to the village safely.{nl}Now I have to get ready for the experiments again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001134	...Oh! Whoops!{nl}I must have dropped my base reagent somewhere {nl}while I was running away from the testing tent...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001135	I can't do any more experiments without it, what a stupid mistake.{nl}What should I do...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001136	Yes! That's it!{nl}How on earth did you get a hold of it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001137	Oh... I must have dropped it in the tent I was conducting experiments in.{nl}It's a relief to have it back. Thank you so much. You're absolutely the best!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001138	Now I have to collect the remaining ingredients.{nl}I can get most of the herbs on my own, but I don't think I can take on the Blue Spion by myself...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001139	So do you think that you could get some Spion Tree Leaves for me?{nl}I'll try to gather the other herbs in the meantime.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001140	Thanks a lot.{nl}Let's meet up back here once we've finish gathering the ingredients.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001141	You're back earlier than I expected.{nl}I hope you didn't have too hard a time dealing with the Blue Spion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001142	Now all I have to do is to mix the reagent with these ingredients.{nl}The only problem is that the monsters seem to be attracted to the smell of the reagent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001143	Could you deal with any monsters that happen to come near me while I mix the reagent?{nl}So that I can focus entirely on mixing the reagent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001144	It's finally finished! Thank you so much. {nl}I couldn't have dreamed of finishing the reagent without your help!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001145	Now all that's left is to test the reagent.{nl}Luckily, I've seen an appropriate vine near the Herb Broker Tent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001146	Tree vines don't usually grow in Nahash Forest, but that place seems to be the exception.{nl}Strange isn't it? It almost seems like someone is raising them there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001147	It just doesn't seem right just like that enormous plant.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001148	Well whatever the case, that tree vine seems to be perfect to test the reagent on.{nl}How about doing the last experiment together since we've crafted the reagent together? 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001149	Did you see that? The vine grew and then crumbled!{nl}It's a success! Our reagent actually worked!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001150	I can't believe that I completed a reagent without the help of Vaidotas...{nl}I'm so happy. The next Alchemist Master will be me when I show the family this reagent!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001151	So. Let's go the the Ownerless Reclaimed Land. {nl}I'm sure that we'll be able to get rid of the enormous {nl}plant there and stop the plants from expanding further.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001152	Alchemist Master
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001153	Lucienne Winterspoon...{nl}May I ask how you came to learn of the name of that troublemaker?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001154	What? You've brought me a reagent that she made in Nahash Forest?{nl}Please give that to me. What has she concocted up this time...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001155	...Oh dear. {nl}Did you perhaps test this reagent? {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001156	This reagent accelerates plant growth.{nl}The plant will crumble if it doesn't have the strength to withstand it but if it does...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001157	We don't have time for this.{nl}Knowing Lucienne, she might have already gone to use the reagent somewhere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001158	I'll give you this counteragent. Please hurry and give this to Lucienne.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001159	What took you so long?{nl}You said you'd ask Vaidotas didn't you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001160	Having a healthy amount of scholarly ambition is something to be commemorated.{nl}But passion past her skills is not good for Lucienne.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001161	...Okay. I guess I was wrong this time.{nl}Something bad could have happened without Vaidotas' help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001162	That doesn't mean that I've lost to Vaidotas though!{nl}Don't you know that failure is the mother of success?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001163	I've failed miserably this time so I'm going to get a great breakthrough soon!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001164	There's no time for this.{nl}I think I can do the rest of the experiments by myself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001165	Farewell then. I thank you for all the help you've given me. {nl}I never forget my debts, so I will repay it one day by helping you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001166	No... Wait...{nl}Why is Vaidotas being brought up in this?!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001167	It's me who succeeded in the experiment, so why should Vaidotas get to see this?{nl}I've mixed this reagent, so why should Vaidotas...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001168	Is it because the vine we tested it on grew a bit?{nl}What does that have to do with anything. It's gone thanks to my reagent!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001169	...If it bothers you that much, you go by yourself.{nl}I don't want to go. Do as you please.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001170	Even though it's a bit infuriating, but Vaidotas took {nl}a look at my reagent's ingredients and mix ratio.{nl}It seems that I should have used Spion Teeth instead of the leaves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001171	I can get the rest of the materials, but Spions are still to much for me...{nl}Could you get me some Spion Teeth?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001172	Well... It would be nice if this mix ratio succeeds..{nl}It will mean that Vaidotas is wrong if it fails so...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001173	It would seem rude to not proceed with the experiment when he's being so considerate...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001174	Thanks. {nl}I'm going to humiliate Vaidotas after succeeding and improving the reagent!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001175	Are you planning on going elsewhere?{nl}Hm... Well then...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001176	I took a look at the soil from a farm on the Ownerless Reclaimed Land, and it was superb.{nl}I think that if I plant some experimental herbs there, they'll do well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001177	I'll give you the herb seeds. {nl}Could you plant them if you happen to pass by the Ownerless Reclaimed Land?{nl}Come on, you can help me out just a bit more can't you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001178	I wouldn't have been able to get this far with the research without you.{nl}Even though I don't want to admit it, V-Vaidotas helped as well...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001179	Villager Nella
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001180	Thank you for saving us at the monastery.{nl}I can't imagine what that swindler would've done to us if it wasn't for you...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001181	Still, the swindler's incantation seems to be having a bit of an effect.{nl}We haven't been attacked by monsters for a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001182	Well, that doesn't mean that we can live in harmony with the monsters.{nl}We also don't know when we'll be attacked by the monsters again because the incantation's effect will wear off later.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001183	Could you help deal with the monsters near the town?{nl}It'll be much safer if you could help out a little.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001184	The village has been totally destroyed while we were trapped at the monastery.{nl}Well this... I suppose it was our own fault for getting tricked like that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001185	Thank you.{nl}Oh, I don't think you'll have to worry about the rest of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001186	Lucienne Winterspoon said that she'll craft us monster repellant while she stays here.{nl}I hope you'll stay safe on your travels.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001187	Welcome. Brother.{nl}Have you come to be redeemed by us of the Tree of Truth?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001188	If so, welcome.{nl}I was just educating the believers of our creed.{nl}How about you join us for a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001189	Good. {nl}Now, I shall begin the sermon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001190	Oh yes... It might be a bit dizzy at first.{nl}That is all part of the process in receiving the Divine Tree's blessing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001191	How was your first sermon about the creed? {nl}Was it alright?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001192	Good, good.{nl}I welcome you once more.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001193	Although the Divine Tree is benevolent, redemption does not come for free.{nl}You must work for the chance to be redeemed.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001194	Helping other believers might be a good place to start since you are new.{nl}I hope to see you soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001195	Greetings. Brother.{nl}Have you received the Demon Soul Orb from Dominikas?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001196	The demons will not attack you on sight if you hold an orb filled with their souls.{nl}It seems as if you have yet to receive the orb from Dominikas.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001197	I have an extra Soul Orb.{nl}But... you'll have to fill it with demon souls yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001198	Still, you won't have to worry about demons attacking you once it's filled with demon souls.{nl}The benevolent Divine Tree shall protect you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001199	I've learned that although demons are our enemies, they are also to be redeemed just like us.{nl}We will all become one in the blessings of the Divine Tree.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001200	I see you've filled the orb.{nl}How was it? I assume the demons didn't attack you on the way back?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001201	What? You were attacked?{nl}That's strange. It is most likely due to your lack of faith.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001202	Ah, look at the time...{nl}Pardon me, I must prepare to attend an important ritual.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001203	Welcome. You're the newcomer, right?{nl}I am selecting scriptures here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001204	To us, the goddesses are immoral as only the Divine Tree can offer true redemption.{nl}We no longer need the old scriptures that worship the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001205	What do we do with the useless scriptures?{nl}We usually gather them and burn them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001206	Thank you for saving me!{nl}Of course, this is all because of the blessing of the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001207	Why do you think the demons attacked us?{nl}That is strange... This has never happened before.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001208	Farewell then... I need to attend a ritual.{nl}Make sure you're not late either, brother. I will see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001209	Villager James
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001210	Oh, so you are the newcomer.{nl}It's a pleasure to meet you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001211	I am purifying the corrupted power of the goddesses with the red blood of the demons. {nl}However, it seems that I've run out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001212	Normally Dominikas gets it for me but he seems to be busy at the moment.{nl}Not to mention the fact that we are currently under {nl}their protection so we can't attack them either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001213	That's why I want you to go get some red demon blood.{nl}As a recruit you can do this much, no?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001214	Thank you.{nl}Demon blood has a special power that can purify the corrupted power of the goddesses.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001215	Look around you, all of this was the result of my purification.{nl}How about it, beautiful isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001216	Well it's about time I leave.{nl}You're free to wander the monastery but try not to go near {nl}the black wall in the Annex Laboratory up there.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001217	That wall is full of holy energy so that only those chosen {nl}by the Divine Tree such as Dominikas can go there.{nl}Well then, see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001218	...How did you get in here?{nl}This is a sacred place that only those who are chosen by the Divine Tree may enter.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001219	Oh my, it appears that the Divine Tree has already chosen you.{nl}I knew you were something special the moment I laid my eyes upon you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001220	To think that you were chosen the moment you joined, this is quite an amazing turn of events.{nl}There is a very important ritual coming up... a ritual to bestow the Divine Tree's blessings.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001221	All the other followers are waiting at the passage that leads to the annex.{nl}Although I must go ahead in order to prepare for the ritual, please take your time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001222	Hurry and deliver this.{nl}I can no longer stand to see the corrupted power of the goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001223	I feel an evil presence coming from the vines that Dominikas left behind.{nl}To think that our monastery might have been covered in such a thing, how frightening.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001224	Is there any way to get rid of those vines?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001225	Hmm...You say that you need a particular reagent to get rid of the vines?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001226	You've arrived at just the right time.{nl}The reagent that Vaidotas was working on is done.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001227	Here!{nl}I'll call it "Lucienne's Special Reagent"!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001228	...What's wrong?{nl}It's real this time! I made sure it's safe this time!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001229	Even if you can't trust me you should trust Vaidotas!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001230	Welcome back.{nl}Please hurry, I don't want to look at the terrible vines any longer.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001231	That's Winterspoon for you!{nl}It's almost like that vine was never there, thank you so much, Revelator!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001232	Sorry for making you help us so much...{nl}We owe you our sincere thanks.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001233	I am talking about the scripture from the Order of the Tree of Truth left by Dominikas.{nl}It turns out that the impious thing still remains in the monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001234	If you see the fake scripture, could you bring it to me?{nl}We're too short-handed to spare anyone at the moment...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001235	Those at the Order of the Tree of Truth... to think they would corrupt the power of the goddesses...{nl}This is just blasphemy to the goddesses!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001236	So you've found the fake scripture. Thank you.{nl}Give it to me and I will take care of it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001237	S-Stop...!{nl}I will do whatever you ask me, so please stop!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001238	Should I just join the Order of the Tree of Truth?{nl}If I did, would I be able to escape this hunger?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001239	Lies...{nl}If not... How... The black wall...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001240	It seems that he's been malnourished for a long time.{nl}I can't talk to him now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001241	Thank you so much...{nl}I am so sorry for misunderstanding you. I thought something was going wrong...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001242	After I regained my consciousness, I felt this mysterious energy from you.{nl}What happened?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001243	Ah... So you're the Revelator.{nl}I guess this is why the black wall couldn't block you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001244	Thank you. I was able to survive because of you.{nl}Dominikas... He's more cruel than the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001245	It hasn't been a long time since Dominikas visited the Elgos Monastery.{nl}I thought he was just an accompanying monk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001246	Not so long after he came here, the tree vines and the {nl}demons suddenly swept the monastery annex.{nl}The villagers fled there... But, he stopped them appropriately.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001247	When I think about it, it was all a facade.{nl}The raid of the tree vines and the sudden attacks of the demons...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001248	As the villagers started to follow him, he quickly showed his true nature.{nl}He asked us to create a sinister idol and believe in the Divine Tree.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001249	Of course, we resisted... But he locked us into that black wall.{nl}He gave us just enough water to stay alive and tried to convert us to his religion.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001250	I felt so painful since I didn't know what to do.{nl}Ah... The abbot!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001251	The abbot must be locked inside the monastery.{nl}I was hoping that the goddesses would protect us... {nl}But we will be in trouble if we don't quickly give you the food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001252	Elgos Abbot
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001253	This energy... Yes, it's you. The Revelator.{nl}It seems the goddesses finally answered my prayer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001254	Ah, nothing. If the other monks are alright, the food will be okay...{nl}I don't think I'll be able to swallow the food.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001255	He's too old... Is he going to be alright...?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001256	As expected, Revelator, you're not blocked by the black wall.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001257	The sinister idol that was created by Dominikas in front of Pagarba Chapel...{nl}The black wall started to cover the monastery because of that idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001258	If we destroy that sinister idol...{nl}There might be a good chance that the whole wall may disappear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001259	I just don't know how I can destroy it...{nl}There is nothing I can think of at the moment.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001260	No, wait...{nl}I can sense the demons' souls from you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001261	That sphere you have...{nl}Is a demon's soul locked inside it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001262	That's it.{nl}Maybe we can use this to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001263	The idea is to purify the demons' souls and use their power.{nl}Unfortunately, we lack the right amount of souls to destroy the idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001264	Can you fill it with a little bit more of the demons' souls?{nl}As you already may know, defeating demons will automatically absorb their souls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001265	Without a doubt the demons are strong... that's why I guess that their souls are strong as well.{nl}My sacred energy is not strong enough to purify this much power.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001266	We should somehow borrow the power of holy water...{nl}Like I told you before though, I have nothing at the moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001267	I am so sorry, but can you get me Holy Water from the Priest Master in Klaipeda?{nl}If we have enough holy water, we'll be able to purify the demons' fallen souls.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001268	Please use the statue of Goddess Vakarine near Viyme Fountain.{nl}You can quickly come back from Klaipeda.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001269	With this, you'll be able to purify the souls contained within the Soul Sphere.{nl}Now, give me a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001270	Since the power of a demon's soul is strong, the residual power after purification possesses strength as well.{nl}This power has the capability to destroy the sinister idol.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001271	Put the purified Soul Sphere's power into the sinister idol.{nl}I hope the idol can't endure this...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001272	Finally!{nl}Now, we can be freed from the black wall.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001273	It's been such a long time...{nl}I think my prayer to the goddesses was not in vain...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001274	Now, we'll need to focus on the main culprit of the Order of the Tree of Truth, Dominikas...{nl}Everything will be over once we drive him out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001275	Please lend me your power a little longer.{nl}Even if we have the methods to catch him, we can't use our powers {nl}since the villagers have been possessed from being tortured so long...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001276	He seems to have some sort of power that allows him to control plants.{nl}I sincerely warn you that he is not to be underestimated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001277	Dominikas... He ran away...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001278	We shouldn't worry too much.{nl}It's a big blow that we drove out the Order of the Tree of Truth from the Elgos Monastery.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001279	And the monsters instead of plants' explosion, I guess it stopped since the spell was unstable.{nl}We were able to protect the villagers because of you.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001280	When we get better, we will clean up the monastery.{nl}Of course, we should drive out the demons as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001281	Even if the world collapses, we believe in people like you who give hope...{nl}You give us the power to endure.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001282	I don't want to imagine what would've happened without you...{nl}On behalf of the whole monastery, we greatly appreciate your help.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001283	You've done it!{nl}The black wall disappeared...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001284	Thank you for saving the monastery.{nl}Ah, is the abbot alright?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001285	...So that is it. {nl}Your faith is as strong as I imagined.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001286	Good! Anything. {nl}Just tell me what I can do for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001287	What? {nl}So the villagers think we ran away after abandoning the monastery?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001288	Those people at the Order of the Tree of Truth... {nl}They locked others inside and alienated them...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001289	Can you go to the villagers with me?{nl}If you are with me, all misunderstandings will be solved.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001290	Hmm... It seems that the villagers found out the true identity of Dominikas.{nl}It is fortunate that the task was solved easier than expected...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001291	I will send the villagers back to the village.{nl}I really appreciate that you've reclaimed the Elgos Monastery from the Order of the Tree of Truth.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001292	The demons here are very strong. {nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001293	Don't underestimate the power of the sinister idol.{nl}Be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001294	Now, the Revelator will continue the journey by following the will of the goddesses.{nl}But before you leave, can you do me one more favor for this old man?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001295	Although we got rid of the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}The evil demons still prevail.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001296	If you lend me your power, we'll be able to drive out the demons much faster.{nl}Can you defeat the demons here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001297	There is something that is bothering me.{nl}I think driving out the Order of the Tree of Truth was wonderful, but...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001298	Dominikas ran away.{nl}I think he may come back by leading the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001299	I want to prepare something for this...{nl}Can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001300	If Dominikas comes back again...{nl}Then, I will not stand idly by.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001301	Thank you. {nl}I can relax now because of you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001302	Good. You should do it.{nl}I was actually going to Veyrhas Hall to burn the scripture...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001303	It's better to see it once than to hear it a hundred times.{nl}Let's go together. Brother.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001304	I didn't know that one of people of the Winterspoon family came to Nahash Forest.{nl}Even so, since you know this person, he or she must be reliable.{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001305	I can't exactly remember what I did back then.{nl}It's as if I was possessed by something...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001306	Yes! {nl}I wouldn't have done such a disrespectful act with a conscious mind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001307	I will apologize to the other monks later.{nl}I can't believe what I did.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001308	Look around you.{nl}Don't you think it's beautiful?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001309	The red blood of demons contain special powers.{nl}That's why only their blood can wash away the corrupted power of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001310	The Order of the Tree of Truth turned the monastery into a complete mess...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001311	We have to clean up the blood of the demons and tidy up the scripture...{nl}We have many things to do.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001312	It will be effective!{nl}Even so... If it goes wrong, you should tell me... For sure...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001313	Revelator, I am eternally thankful to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001314	Dominikas opened my eyes to a new light.{nl}Only the Divine Tree can save us...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001315	I need to save my power since we don't know when {nl}the Order of the Tree of Truth will attack the monastery again.{nl}I really thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001316	How could we lose the monastery to a heresy like the Order of the Tree of Truth...{nl}I am sorry to the goddess and I am thankful to her.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001317	I won't be deceived by the lies of the goddess anymore.{nl}You also think so, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001318	You really are...{nl}You might be the envoy that was sent by the goddess...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001319	What's strange is that Dominikas often visited Pagarba Chapel.{nl}It could very well mean that he may have hidden something important there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001320	If you hide there, you will definitely manage to ambush Dominikas.{nl}I will pray for you in the name of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001321	As we cleaned up the monastery...{nl}I found a bunch of the Soul Spheres that were left by Dominikas.{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001322	Can you remember when you broke the sinister idol?{nl}How about I put the demon souls into the sphere and purify them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001323	I will give you the Soul Sphere if you could defeat the demons with these, please.{nl}You can put the souls into this sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001324	One day, I will become the Alchemist Master!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001325	I'll receive help from Vaidotas until I become the Alchemist Master.{nl}It's not because I lost to Vaidotas, it's just that I'm trying to use him!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001326	Really!!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001327	I sense something strange in the villagers. As he said, let's help the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001328	Believe in the Divine Tree and let it save you.{nl}The door of the Order of the Tree of Truth is always open.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001329	Fake goddesses, untruthful doctrines... Are you sure that your belief in them has become quite strong?{nl}But that's the wrong path to salvation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001330	Tell me when you are ready.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001331	I regret that I may have done something wrong due to hunger.{nl}If Dominikas came instead of you... we wouldn't have been able to go back...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001332	I am worried about the abbot.{nl}He is old... I hope the goddesses take care of him...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001333	Ahah... No matter how much I think, there is no way.{nl}Now, everything may be ruined...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001334	I haven't seen you before.{nl}What has brought you this far?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001335	It doesn't matter.{nl}If you have time, could you listen to this old man for a while?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001336	This was... originally a sea...{nl}We were fishers who caught fishes in this sea.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001337	But, as you can see...{nl}The land suddenly soared upwards.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001338	At first, I was thinking whether I should quit fishing, but... it soon turned out alright.{nl}I've earned a lot of money by picking up corals. {nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001339	The monsters were, without a doubt, a bit scary, but the lord was there to help us.{nl}The lord sent her army and the Lord Lieutenant in exchange for a offering.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001340	But not too long ago, the monsters went crazy.{nl}We couldn't pick up the corals and even had to evacuate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001341	Of course, we have told the Lord Lieutenant about this.{nl}However, he said protecting the town and defeating the monsters {nl}were two different things, and the latter would cost additional tributes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001342	We've ran out of the corals that we've collected. {nl}The merchants are waiting for us... What should we do...{nl} 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001343	I'm just saying it is.{nl}Thank you for listening to the complaints of an old man.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001344	Hmm... Are you the rumored Revelator?{nl}I've heard you possess quite talented skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001345	Have you heard of the coral named Lhu'uvik?{nl}It's a valuable coral used for creating magical tools or for finding magic principles.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001346	I've come all this way to trade it...{nl}But as you can probably see, I've gotten in to trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001347	There is nothing more important than the schedules and the promises of a merchant.{nl}If we go empty-handed like this, we will suffer from tremendous damage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001348	It's not only us, but it also counts for those villagers.{nl}If it continues like this, they will lose their jobs and {nl}be forced to look for other places to live.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001349	I want to borrow your power to help those poor villagers.{nl}Can you help me so that they can start collecting coral again?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001350	Thank you for accepting.{nl}First, that lieutenant doesn't want to receive anything besides the corals for tributes.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001351	Eventually, we will have to get rid of the monsters so that the villagers can gather corals.{nl}You are the only one I can trust, please get rid of them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001352	I hope this clears things up...{nl}In case something happens, while you are taking care of it, {nl}I will send a person to look at the status of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001353	It will be great if we could just drive out the monsters, but...{nl}Something's up.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001354	Oh, you've come back already?{nl}You're just as great as I've heard.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001355	I knew it wouldn't be that easy.{nl}It's so strange that many monsters are rushing in so quickly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001356	This is not just related to the monsters. There must be a different reason.{nl}I will investigate this seperately. Can you ask people here if they saw anything strange?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001357	You would think the Lord Lieutenant would be the first one to help, but no!{nl}He would rather waste his time threatening us... How strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001358	If it was just a matter of taxing additional tributes,{nl}why doesn't the Lord Lieutenant take some measures.{nl}Anyway, how did the investigation go?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001359	So as the number of monsters increased, the strange smell started to spread.{nl}Hmm...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001360	I can't think that the monsters are not related to the smell.{nl}Can you check where that smell is coming from?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001361	If we are lucky enough, we might be able to find the source of the smell.{nl}If you find it, please bring it to me. I will get rid of it right away.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001362	I am counting on you.{nl}Please check the coast for spots where the smell is coming from.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001363	The smell and the monsters...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001364	Just as I thought! In the contents of the pouch was a powder that allures monsters.{nl}Somebody must have deliberately used them to draw the monsters in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001365	If the smell disappears, there will be no reason for the monsters to go crazy.{nl}Can you dig out the same pouches from the pit?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001366	I will find out more about the pouch in the meantime.{nl}I don't know yet whether it someone left it on accident or on purpose.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001367	Oh my god... This many...{nl}I can see why so many monsters are being drawn in.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001368	Someone is definitely disturbing the coral harvesting.{nl}I don't know why, but whoever behind it must be evil.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001369	Yes.{nl}I told you that the Lord Lieutenant is little strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001370	It would've been quite efficient if the Lord Lieutenant would personally go out and defeat the monsters.{nl}Even if this delays the tribute delivery a bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001371	Yet, he didn't do it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001372	If he knows defeating the monsters is a waste of time...{nl}I think everything is coming together, now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001373	If what I am thinking is correct, the Lord Lieutenant will try to steal the tributes.{nl}However we don't have the evidence to support that claim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001374	Alright... Let's answer our suspicions right now. Do we lure the suspect out?{nl}I want you to be responsible for the most important role.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001375	I've told the Lord Lieutenant in advance.{nl}The smell was spreading badly in the pit, making it unable to bear.{nl}I've gotten rid of the source and he thanked me for that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001376	In the meantime, please hide with the mayor.{nl}Of course, the soldier who will catch the culprit should join. {nl}He should act like an observer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001377	Of course, we can't rule out that some of the soldiers may have had a hand in this...{nl}But, you don't have to worry since Basilius is reliable and a very close friend of mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001378	Anyway, since the Lord Lieutenant found out that all the pouches were removed...{nl}He will appear again and bury the pocket.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001379	Let's strike all at once, then.{nl}I will block the retreat route in case something happens. 
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001380	I am counting on you then.{nl}When you go, I will start my task as well.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001381	You're safe.{nl}Don't worry, the Lord Lieutenant was caught with the villagers.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001382	What a cruel and cunning man. Cowardly and dishonorable as well. {nl}He also ratted other soldiers out.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001383	As I expected, they were stealing the tributes.{nl}They lured the monsters and began to steal in earnest.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001384	He was blinded by greed and endangered everyone...{nl}I am well acquainted with the lord. Let me take the other soldiers to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001385	Due to your help, I was able to keep to the schedule and start picking up the corals again.{nl}Thank you so much. You've saved us and the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001386	After you have removed all the pouches from the Lhu'uvik Coral Reef,{nl}the number of monsters have decreased quite significantly.{nl}Such a blessing... It's truly a blessing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001387	But what if some pouches are still out there...{nl}The monsters are coming more slowly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001388	Thank you.{nl}You keep helping us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001389	You are a godsend to us.{nl}Without you, we would have turned into refugees once again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001390	You found them all? {nl}What a relief.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001391	Hmm, maybe... This is just an idea,{nl}but how about we throw the powder from the pouches away from the pit?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001392	Then, the monsters will be directed there. Right?{nl}Can you help us out?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001393	Near the Atskiles Cay would be the ideal spot.{nl}Godspeed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001394	As mayor, it's embarrassing, but I almost gave up on everything.{nl}Whatever it is, I think we made the right choice with staying put.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001395	A large number of monsters came? {nl}Damn it... It was very effective, but it puts us in danger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001396	I am so sorry to give you a hard task.{nl}I'll tell everyone not to touch the pouch.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001397	That coral... Where did you get it?{nl}That's called Arnim. It's a very important coral used in medicine.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001398	There must be a habitat near the place where you obtained it...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001399	I am sorry, but can you look for their habitat?{nl}If you could look for the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would help the villagers a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001400	If you could find the habitat of the Arnim coral, it would be of great help to the villagers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001401	Nugara Sandbank?{nl}That deep... We will have hard time extracting it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001402	We better let the refugees know. We should find a way together.{nl}Thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001403	I am sorry, but can you help us out?{nl}A lot of us are wounded, but we're short on medicine... {nl}Things are getting worse the longer we go without help...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001404	We've already used all the medicine the merchants could offer,{nl}and we have no way of getting any more.{nl}We can make an ointment if we have the ingredients...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001405	Please, get me Greentoshell Shell Fragments and Blue Lapasape Mosses.{nl}With those I can make an emergency ointment for the injuries.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001406	It's not a severe cut, but if we leave it, it will decay.{nl}There are many people hurt, but I can't do a thing...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001407	Thank you. Thank you so much.{nl}This will help you a lot.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001408	I am sorry. I found a small box that looked like it fell from a wrecked ship...{nl}Do you know anything about it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001409	Ahah... So you don't know.{nl}This is sealed with magic so it can't be opened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001410	Something important seems to be inside...{nl}Can you help me open the box?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001411	The ship that this box was on probably also has the device to unseal it.{nl}But we have only found the box. So, we have no idea from which ship it came from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001412	It must be buried somewhere around the wrecked ship or the area near it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001413	What could possibly be inside it for someone to go this far to seal it?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001414	What is this bag?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160310_001415	Ah, there is a small magical stone in the bag!{nl}Thank you for finding it for me.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20160323_001977	Lutas wants to create Binding Magic Circles to protect the newly drawn ones. He believes the ones he created at first were too dangerous, as they worked on both monsters and humans, so he has given you a new magic circle scroll.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002010	We're offering supplies to travelers who come through here.{nl}Go inside and look for the Assistant Commander.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002011	It's been long since we've seen a traveler.{nl}You must be tired, coming all the way here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002012	Talk to the Assistant Commander to receive the supplies.{nl}Don't refuse them and… I wish you a safe travel.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002017	Did the Assistant Commander send you?{nl}I was just… organizing these traveler supplies.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002018	The supplies are at Valaska…{nl}Wait, no.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002021	Herntas sent you?{nl}Ah… I see. Can't be helped, then.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002022	The rest of the supplies aren't yet fully organized, you see.{nl}It really can't be helped.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002023	I guess it's best if you go get the rest of the supplies yourself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002024	We have a warehouse in Valaska Hillside.{nl}Tell Supply Soldier Delyn there that I sent you and get the supplies.

QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002029	After Medzio Diena, all contact from the kingdom suddenly stopped.{nl}Without news of operations or reports, the troops themselves were crushed…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002030	Then, Demon Kentauros appeared with his vassals.{nl}He said he would spare our lives if we agreed to his deal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002031	He told us to find and kill the one called the Revelator. {nl}In return, he would keep us alive and fed…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002032	We didn't even know what a Revelator was.{nl}Besides, who would come to a dangerous place like this?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002033	We decided to take the chance and keep living.{nl}The lives of our very troops were at stake so we had no choice.{nl}We just had to survive no matter how…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002034	Some did try to escape, of course.{nl}But each one of them… was made into a gruesome example of what could happen to us…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002035	Yes… We prayed every day that no one would come…{nl}But then you… I don't know what to tell you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002036	I've lost my honor as member of the Royal Army, and my own life now.{nl}If I keep you safe, will I be able to repent…?{nl}

QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002038	Soldier Callans
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002039	You already prepared the trap?{nl}Wow…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002040	The bomb I have isn't powerful enough.{nl}If we're to set it up over there… Even without the proper calculations, I don't see it being enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002041	Oh, you will?{nl}Then please bring me some black rocks from Uzsaldi Plateau.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002042	I'll be here preparing to enhance the bomb meanwhile.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002043	This bomb wasn't made to kill, you see.{nl}If we don't work on it, this will be nothing but a joke to the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002044	Oh, this is it.{nl}Just a wait a while.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002045	Finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's not too stable, but it's definitely powerful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002046	Now, for the next step.{nl}We need to set up this bomb somewhere the demons will walk by.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002047	Will you?{nl}Let's go together, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002048	Be careful with it.{nl}I did manage to enhance the bomb, but since I had to rush it, it's not very stable.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002049	Thank you so much.{nl}Now.. the operation begins.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002050	What are you doing? Why don't you run?{nl}We disobeyed the demons, they'll be here any second!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002051	Do you really mean it?{nl}You want us to… defeat the demons together?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002052	We were going to hurt you!{nl}I'd think you would at least resent us… instead you make humbled criminals of us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002053	Alright.{nl}If I'm going to die, I might as well repent to you while I can.{nl}The thing that worries me is that... everyone is terrified of Kentauros.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002054	I realised what it is we were missing.{nl}You awoke that in us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002055	Yes… I remember now.{nl}We are the Royal Army!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002056	Never did we imagine an operation of this caliber.{nl}With someone as strong as you on our side, I'm not afraid to put my life at risk.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002057	My plan is to attract as many demons as possible to the trap to reduce their numbers.{nl}But we can't let a monster get caught instead and ruin the plan.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002058	The operation is taking place at Uzsaldi Plateau.{nl}Will you take care of the monsters around the trap?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002059	This trap wasn't easy to set, it would be a shame to see it ruined by monsters.{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002060	Slowly we're getting ready to fight the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002061	First we need to lure the demons with wooden fences.{nl}The soldiers are busy with other tasks, so I want to ask you to do it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002062	My debt to you just keeps growing.{nl}You can get the fences from the supplies box in front of Herntas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002063	If only we can make this work…{nl}We could finally escape the clutches of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002064	Are the fences ready?{nl}Good.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002065	Now we just need Soldier Callans to set up the trap to begin the operation…{nl}He's a little late.{nl}It'd be great if you could help him, just in case.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002066	Alright. We're ready.{nl}The soldiers sent to spread false information to the demons already reported back, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002067	They say Kentauros is coming this way.{nl}And apparently he's furious.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002068	Everything's running smoothly.{nl}I just hope we succeed…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002069	Is it… over?{nl}I can finally return as soldier of the Kingdom… It's been so hard…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002070	I would have lived a miserable life if it weren't for you.{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002071	We might have escaped the demons, but this is far from over.{nl}They probably don't even know we're alive back in the Kingdom…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002072	We need a way to contact the Kingdom!{nl}Then we can think about going back to our families.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002073	But how do we tell them about this…{nl}It's not easy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002074	Are you talking about Uska from Klaipeda?{nl}If so, then… please, do me the favor!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002075	Telling Uska about what happened to outr troops should be enough.{nl}That and… we're ready to take responsibility for the things we did.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002076	You mean the troops were still alive?{nl}That's a relief to hear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002077	We ought to get them back to their hometowns but…{nl}Given the urgency of their situation, we will first make sure to send them supplies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002078	Thank you for reporting this information.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002079	Hopefully Uska will be able to help us…{nl}As for our punishment… I'm not sure.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002080	You have no idea how we feel right now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002081	Uska is sending us supplies?{nl}That's a relief. To think I can go back to my hometown, too…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002082	And…{nl}No word about our punishment?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002083	You left that out on purpose?{nl}You really… I get why there's no match for the Revelators now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002084	I'm sorry… and thank you for speaking on behalf of our troops!{nl}Your favor will not be forgotten.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002085	Soldier Guylens
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002086	There's nowhere colder than this place.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002087	Thanks to you we defeated Kentauros…{nl}But his vassals are still around.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002088	Our soldiers are too exhausted from the battle.{nl}But now that we have freedom… we need to protect it at all costs…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002089	Will you really?{nl}My debt to you just keeps growing.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002090	Here we have to battle not just monsters but the freezing cold, so it's never easy.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002091	If only we can pull through this…{nl}There'll be nothing else holding us down!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002092	You brought us a lot of relief, but I'm still worried about the remaining vassals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002093	Who're you?{nl}The monsters are coming.{nl}Aren't you going to run away like those cowardly soldiers?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002094	Me?{nl}I'm going to try and pull through it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002095	Wow, you're pretty good.{nl}Defeating that huge monster all by yourself, now that's impressive!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002096	Oh, I just remembered.{nl}I was supposed to finish my damage report but the monsters got me distractred.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002097	I'm sorry, but would you take care of the wounded miners for me?{nl}You can use the herbs from before to make the antiseptic.{nl}Sorry for the trouble.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002098	The miners are over to the left.{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002099	Soldier Andre
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002100	If we do nothing, all my fellow soldiers could die.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002101	We need to save them as soon as possible…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002102	Let's see… I don't think we have enough people for the Dimensional Stone.{nl}What do we do…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002103	There weren't enough of us to stop all the demons coming out of Kaleimas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002104	We would have been exterminated if it weren't for Assistant Commander Vilas.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002105	How's the healing process?{nl}Looks like you talked to the miners, too.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002106	As you know, we're too short on people.{nl}Especially since the soldiers, who we need the most, all ran away in fear.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002107	If only we know where the Dimensional Stone is, I think we can make do with the workers we have…{nl}The problem is the monsters.{nl}Nothing but an annoyance…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002108	If you help us out with this, we can do the rest.{nl}For now I marked some areas that look promising.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002109	Lezsa Hill has the highest probability.{nl}Go there and use this detector to find the Dimensional Stone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002110	Make sure to mark the spot so we can find it later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002111	If it weren't for the monsters it would be a lot easier.{nl}As for the demons… I don't even want to talk about those.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002112	You really saved us here.{nl}Your help has been precious to the Kedoran Alliance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002113	Oh, and I'm very grateful for your help, but please don't tell anyone about the Dimensional Stone.{nl}Last time some baron opened this weird door and… let's just say it wasn't pretty.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002114	I guess that's it…{nl}You're a Revelator, we're followers of the goddess; I'm sure we'll meet again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002115	Why did we come to this dangerous place, you wonder…{nl}First of all, I work for the Kedoran Merchant Alliance.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002116	This is actually a secret, but anyways.{nl}If I tell you this then you'll have to help us out, though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002117	So, what do you say? It'd be great if you could help.{nl}It's all in the name of the goddess, no personal gains to be had from this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002118	If you're a Revelator I think it's fine to tell you anyways. {nl}It's all because of the Dimensional Stone, you see.{nl}With it, you can travel between dimensions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002119	I see you're not getting it.{nl}Neither do we, actually.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002120	We at the Kedoran Alliance are just doing as the goddess told us.{nl}She said the world needed us, so we're just fulfilling that role as best as we can.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002121	If the demons get a hold of it we know it's not gonna end well so we've been working in secret…{nl}But our workers and soldiers all ran away, afraid of the monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002122	Even if we send out a letter for more personnel, it's gonna take a while.{nl}The only miner workers left are terrified as well… We're in big trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002123	Good.{nl}First, would you clear out some monsters around here?{nl}We can't have another one like before coming our way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002124	Thank you for helping the Kedoran Alliance.{nl}I knew finding the Dimensional Stone was gonna be hard; I never thought I'd have to risk my life over it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002125	I think we've calmed down now.{nl}Now, shall we start…?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002126	What is it?{nl}Is it because I look like I'm doing something different from everybody else?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002127	Well of course.{nl}As the competent wizard I am, I was especially hired by the Alliance, so yes, my work here is different.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002128	Can't you tell?{nl}I'm researching ores, of course.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002129	If you have time to be asking, why don't you be useful and help me?{nl}Oh, right.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002130	I need something similar to glass.{nl}Blue Cronewt Poisoned Needler magic crystals.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002131	I need to analyze the ore's components, but I can't do that without the crystals.{nl}Understood?{nl}Go on, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002132	I wouldn't be this mad if my bag hadn't been completely destroyed by monsters.{nl}What are you doing?{nl}Hurry and get me the crystals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002133	The Kedoran Alliance was too slow and the monsters took over…{nl}Bad luck all over.{nl}Now give that to me already.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002134	Let's see, hm…{nl}The Dimensional Stone is full of impurities…{nl}I wonder what they're made of…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002135	What?{nl}You want to know about the Dimensional Stone?{nl}Does that mean you were… eavesdropping earlier?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002136	Alright.{nl}I'll tell you, just tone down your voice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002137	Jamelhan says this plain-looking stone has the power to cross dimensions.{nl}Isn't it exciting?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002138	I think that, if used correctly, the Dimensional Stone can take us to the place where the goddess are.{nl}I have no idea how to use its power, though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002139	Since you helped me find out about the impurities in the Stone…{nl}I guess I can start to find out more about it now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002140	You aren't just gonna leave after I told you all of that, are you?{nl}Why don't you give me a hand here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002141	These impurities can interfere with the power of the Dimensional Stone so they need to be removed.{nl}That'll be easier if I can find out what the impurities are made of.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002142	I'm going to extract some pure magic from Magic Stones and have it react with the impurities.{nl}I should be able to infer what they're made of depending on how they react.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002143	There are some Magic Stones south of the stairs in these hills. Would you get me some?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002144	Did you bring back some stones?{nl}Or didn't you leave yet?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002145	These should be enough.{nl}I'll use the stones your brought to find out just what these impurities are.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002146	I found out what the Dimensional Stone's impurities are made of.{nl}In order to extract them, hm… It's a little complicated, but I need some materials.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002147	Luckily all I need is from monsters, which definitely aren't lacking around here.{nl}I'll give you a scroll.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002148	Use this on monsters to temporarily alter their essence, and then…{nl}you need to defeat them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002149	Collect their essence and bring it to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002150	The effects of the scroll don't last too long.{nl}It was made in a rush, so please understand.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002151	You're back. Thank you.{nl}Now I just need… some samples.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002152	I need to know what the Dimensional Stone reacts to.{nl}So I want to test it on some samples.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002153	The samples aren't a problem… The problem is the reagent. I don't have enough.{nl}Would you go to Gado Way and collect some Tiny salivary glands?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002154	Bring them to me as soon as you get them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002155	None of this would be a problem if I still had my bag.{nl}Where are those glands? Is it gonna take long?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002156	Here they are, Tiny salivary glands.{nl}I'm still a little short on research supplies, but I'll get by on my own from now on.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002157	This story has been told in our village since long ago.{nl}Our village was built by the workers from Kaleimas Prison, a prison nearby.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002158	Their peace didn't last long… an epidemic started to spread one day.{nl}The skin would fall off the body, it was a gruesome disease…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002159	Thankfully Maven, who was passing by, cured the disease with a holy relic…{nl}And that relic has been passed on by the people of our village ever since…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002160	But now… Not long ago, Demon Kentauros appeared with his vassals.{nl}He raised statues around the village and cursed it with a disease…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002161	We created a Purification Sphere with Maven's holy relic and succeeded in destroying some of the statues.{nl}But of course, Kentauros did not like that...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002162	We thought they would end us, but all they did was destroy the Sphere.{nl}It's as if they're observing the disease.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002163	We suffer every day…{nl}Our lives cannot end under the demons' watch, but they can't go on under it, either.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002164	Please, I beg you…{nl}Rid us of the cursed statues and the demons, and cure us of this disease.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002165	The person who defeated that group of demons… was you?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002166	Oh… Arntas.{nl}I can't tell if ending the curse is possible now…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002167	Your plan is to destroy the village's surveillance spheres, right?{nl}I'm afraid we have no choice, considering our situation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002168	My body hasn't recovered yet… Please go to Dvejoti Cliff for me and collect black stones.{nl}There's a lot of monsters there so be careful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002169	There was a demon attack and some soldiers still can't leave the base.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002170	They need to be rescued.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002171	We were all just waiting for the day we would return to the goddess…{nl}Can we really escape the curse this time?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002172	You're back.{nl}Can I have them?{nl}It's time to give them hell.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002173	There, it's finished.{nl}I had to rush it so it's a little rough; please be careful with it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002174	Just set up the bomb by the surveillance sphere and run to a safe place.{nl}I used up all the black stones on it, so there's no way to control the power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002175	If it works, go see Priest Chaleims.{nl}We almost succeeded once, so he knows what to do next; he will let you know.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002176	I don't want to live like this anyore.{nl}If we fail again this time I'll…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002177	That was a nice explosion!{nl}Now to make the Purification Sphere before the demons get here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002178	You did it!{nl}Hurry and go to Priest Chaleims!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002179	This isn't the first time I'm making a Purification Sphere, it won't be difficult.{nl}I do require some materials, however… Would you bring me some White Spion essence?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002180	I'll stay here and prepare.{nl}If we fail this time… we'll never be able to escape this life.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002181	You did well.{nl}We have the materials now, all we need is divine energy to make the Purification Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002182	We need the divine energy from Maven's holy relic… to charge the sphere with it.{nl}Originally the sphere was in our village…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002183	But the demons took it to Sventimas Exile and Kadumel Cliff.{nl}That's how powerful Maven's divine energy was.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002184	A lot of time has passed now, the divine force in it will have weakened.{nl}It's buried under the snow, thankfully, so the demons can't see it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002185	Thank you.{nl}Artnas will give you the detection orb and absorption orb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002186	This is the most important step of our plan…{nl}I pray for your success.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002187	To think that, once again, we're using the Maven relics…{nl}I wonder if Maven knew then?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002188	You collected the energy.{nl}That's splendid!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002189	And yet… No news of Artnas.{nl}I hope nothing serious has happened… Hmm…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002190	If you find Artnas, please come back to the village.{nl}We don't know what the demons will do if they find out we destroyed their surveillance sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002191	Thankfully Arntas was just a little startled and will recover with some rest.{nl}The demons seem to have caught on to us however, it would be best to move.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002192	We'll make the Purification Sphere at the altar in Besde Shores.{nl}I will see you there.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002193	You came.{nl}The monsters and the demons seem to have found out that we're up to something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002194	Please keep an eye out while I make the Purification Sphere.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002195	Finished!{nl}The Purification Sphere is complete!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002196	All that's left now is destroying the cursed statues.{nl}Take the Purification Sphere to the statues and the divine energy within it will destroy them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002197	The problem is the statues are being guarded by an army of demons.{nl}The only one able to get pass them… is you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002198	If there's any hope left for us, that's you.{nl}Please… free us from this unbearable misery.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002199	You've done it!{nl}At last… we're free from our dreadful misery…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002200	But it's not over yet.{nl}There are three more cursed statues in Kadumel Cliff.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002201	All three must be destroyed in order to end the curse.{nl}And if the demons find out your identity, they'll only make things harder for us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002202	So please!{nl}Please… destroy the remaining statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002203	A bomb?{nl}With the right materials, sure, I can make a bomb.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002204	My skin is still burnt but…{nl}If this curse ever ends I'll help you with whatever you need.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002205	Really?{nl}My… The goddess did not abandon us…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002206	First we need to destroy the surveillance spheres in the village so we can move freely.{nl}They were set up by the demons to monitor us.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002207	We've tried before, but were caught by the demons.{nl}But you… I know you can do it if you try.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002208	Go meet Argis at the village.{nl}He knows about bombs, he can help you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002209	What are you doing in this cursed place?{nl}Everyone in this village is suffering from a horrendous disease.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002210	I wish I could at least relieve the pain…{nl}But I'm too ill to even go looking for herbs…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002211	Do you mean it?{nl}You don't know how thankful I am…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002212	Bring me some Sikljien herbs if you can.{nl}They grow on the edge of Kadumel Cliff.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002213	I'm in so much pain… it hurts to even move.{nl}The most I can do is cool my fever with the cold breeze.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002214	I'm sick of constantly talking about how much I'm suffering.{nl}But these herbs… I'm grateful for them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002215	We're already suffering from the curse, and now the monsters…{nl}Please.{nl}I just want my mind to be at ease…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002216	I can't even escape from this village.{nl}Because of the demons…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002217	Thank you!{nl}Now if only this curse were to disappear…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002218	Eugh… Run!{nl}The demons are coming!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002219	You saved my life.{nl}Seeing you defeat all those demons... There's no way you're just a normal person.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002220	We're being mercilessly attacked by demons from Kalejimas Prison.{nl}Our troops were retreating back towards Sventimas Exile.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002221	But then we were caught in an ambush and only three of us managed to escape this way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002222	I want to go and rescue the rest of our troops but…{nl}I'm tired from the battle and I'm wounded…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002223	You say you're going to save our troops?{nl}That's extremely brave of you but…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002224	{nl}We're incredibly outnumbered!{nl}Do you still want to go…?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002225	{nl}Alright.{nl}Our troops will be at the Smekla Base, unable to move.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002226	The way to the Base is occupied by demons, so be careful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002227	You're my only hope now.{nl}Please… save our troops.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002228	Assistant Commander Vilas
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002229	A civilian?{nl}How does a civilian end up here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002230	Who are you?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002231	I hope everyone's safe…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002232	I see. Andre…{nl}By the way, did you see anything that looks like a black wall on your way here?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002233	You passed through the black wall?{nl}How on earth did you do that?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002234	We're can't move from here because we couldn't pass over that wall.{nl}We'll never get away from here unless we find a way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002235	We need to know what that wall is so we can either destroy it or break through it.{nl}So we sent Scout Boas to the Lamdyti Workshop.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002236	If you help Boas, we can find out a lot faster.{nl}Please do me that favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002237	Scout Boas
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002238	Are you a demon?!{nl}Reveal yourself!!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002239	Oh, you were sent by Assistant Commander Vilas?{nl}But… how did you pass through the black wall…?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002240	I mean, that's not important now.{nl}But that black wall… it's definitely strange.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002241	I saw some demons guarding an unknown magic device down the road south of the Lamdyti Workshop.{nl}I wonder if that has anything to do with it…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002242	I did try to blow it up with a bomb, but it didn't even budge.{nl}I think we need something more powerful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002243	I'll go and get more bombs.{nl}Meanwhile, will you gather some black stones?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002244	The black stones around here are good for enhancing bombs.{nl}Please do me that favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002245	You got the stones.{nl}I'll get them ready in no time.{nl}Just wait a little while.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002246	I think they're powerful enough now.{nl}Now, to destroy the magic device.{nl}You go first, I'll catch up soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002247	I think this time we can destroy it.{nl}The thing is… what if the problem is not the magic device?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002248	I knew it!{nl}There's no way that would survive my bombs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002249	I wonder if the wall is gone now… We should go back to the troops!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002250	You're just who I wanted to see!{nl}The black wall disappeared and we're ready to retreat.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002251	Are we out now…?{nl}Thanks to you we all managed to retreat in safety.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002252	Losing to the demons in Steel Heights was a shame but…{nl}At least we get to live to see tomorrow.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002253	By the way…{nl}Are you perhaps headed to Kalejimas Prison?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002254	Be careful if go that way.{nl}The demons who nearly finished us all came from there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002255	Anyways, I have to thank you.{nl}May the grace of the goddess be with you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002256	Every time the wind blows it feels like my flesh is being ripped apart.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002257	I'm suddenly reminded of my parents' potato dumplings.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002258	Soldier Hyrance
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002259	How much longer will we have to stay here…?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002260	Soldier Kuijlen
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002261	This unbearable cold is a bigger enemy to us than the monsters themselves.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002262	This place is unbearably cold and full of dangerous monsters.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002263	Soldier Heulen
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002264	How much longer do we have to stay…? I want to go home now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002265	The monsters, the cold… I'm so exhausted.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002266	I feel extremely thankful and sorry for the soldiers who have endured this far.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002267	I'm so grateful to these soldiers who always follow my orders even in these harsh conditions.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002268	If we didn't do as the demons said we'd be dead by now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002269	Being threatened by the demons was really hard on us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002270	We were determined to refuse when the demons offered to give us supplies in exchange for killing the Revelator, but when they threatened to kill us instead if we didn't do it, we had no choice but to obey.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002271	We wanted to resist the demons, but we knew that we couldn't defeat them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002272	We didn't want to kill anyone. But we also didn't want to die.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002273	Now we're as good as dead anyway.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002274	You should run while you still can.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002275	I'm really sorry. We would be dead if we had refused to obey the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002276	If only we weren't short on supplies, this wouldn't have happened…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002277	After we accepted the demons' orders, we prayed that no one would come to Ibre Plateau.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002278	We're just as good as dead to the demons now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002279	When we stopped getting supplies, I wanted to run away. But I couldn't bear to leave my fellow soldiers behind.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002280	We'd be dead if we hadn't obeyed the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002281	I wonder why the Assistant Commander wants to see us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002282	What does the Assistant Commander want to say to us?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002283	The Assistant Commander must have something important to say to us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002284	It sounds like the Assistant Commander has made an important decision.{nl}We'll have to go and seem him.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002285	I think the Assistant Commander made a decision.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002286	I wonder why the Assistant Commander wants to see us.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002287	We're the Kedoran Merchant Alliance.{nl}We supplied materials to the Great Cathedral, the Mage Tower, the Great Goddess Statue in Fedimian, and many other historical construction projects.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002288	You could say we're the backbone of history itself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002289	Everything we thrive for is the will of the goddess.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002290	Mine Worker
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002291	I came all the way here on the promise of a high pay…{nl}I had no idea it would be this dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002292	I wouldn't have applied if I knew how dangerous this place was…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002293	They didn't even hire a soldier to protect us, how can they ask us to work here?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002294	I managed to survive the monster attack, but some experimentation tools were destroyed.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002295	If it weren't for that attack I wouldn't be having such a hard time right now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002296	We managed to ward off the demons earlier but if they attack again we'll be completely exterminated.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002297	We don't have enough soldiers to survive another attack from the demons.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002298	The black wall disappeared. We're able to retreat now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002299	We should leave before the demons attack again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002300	Right, right. Are you by chance the Revelator?{nl}I heard that someone called the Revelator came to Fedimian and is helping other people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002301	As expected.{nl}I can see why you're so talented now.{nl}It seems the goddess haven't abandoned us yet!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002302	The smell and the monsters…{nl}I think I'm on to something.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002303	Dievdirbys Asel
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002304	You… I don't think we've met before.{nl}Sorry for being so direct, but can I ask you a favor?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002305	I was attacked by monsters on my way here.{nl}I should have chased them away but… I can't move now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002306	Oh! Thank you.{nl}You can bring me some herbs then. I now a type that's good for wounds.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002307	Although I'm not too familiar with this area.{nl}But the owl sculptures in Zaliavin Valley should know where to find those herbs.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002308	I hate that I can't move because of the monsters…{nl}And that I have to ask this favor to a stranger… I'm sorry.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002309	The broken owl sculptures you see around here… They don't answer when you talk to them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002310	You say the owl sculptures are broken and don't answer?{nl}What on earth happened there...?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002311	I'm actually here by request of the Dievdirbys Master.{nl}I was tasked with checking the condition of the statues, so I come here about once a month.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002312	I don't think they would be attacked by monsters…{nl}Strange. I should go there myself.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002313	The owl sculptures aren't answering.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002314	If these statues aren't repaired soon, the number of lost spirits will only grow bigger.{nl}But I'm barely able to stand as it is… This is some problem we have here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002315	I'm so sorry.{nl}You're the only one I can depend on right now so I have to ask.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002316	Please do me this favor.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002317	This is terrible.{nl}I feel a strange energy, too…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002318	I'll have a look; please wait here.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002319	Uh? Why are there cuts on the backs of the statues…?{nl}There's an evil energy coming from here. This is not the work of monsters…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002320	I wonder if it's a curse…{nl}It looks like the evil energy is attracting monsters to this area.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002321	This won't be easy, it seems.{nl}It's hard enough to deal with evil energy, but the big problem is repairing the statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002322	Not only do they have cuts, there's broken parts here and there that need to be fixed.{nl}Even with the right materials… the chances look slim.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002323	Thank you for your precious help.{nl}I'll ask you to gather some sticky liquid and broken bows from monsters nearby.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002324	I'm still very wounded, but I can deal with the repair job.{nl}What kind of Dievdirbys would I be if I couldn't?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002325	Oh, you got them.{nl}I'll just tend to the cuts and broken parts and we can move on to the purification.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002326	My body feels like it's about to return to the goddess…{nl}I just hope I have enough strength to repair the statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002327	I've never seen anything like this.{nl}The evil energy isn't disappearing. This could be a curse more powerful than anything I know…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002328	I need to observe the other statues to look for clues, but it's impossible like this.{nl}May I ask you to gather some herbs for me that I can use as a painkiller?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002329	Thank you, I'll trust you to do it.{nl}You can bring me some Yellow Sapous, they're found on the north side of the valley.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002330	I'd get proper treatment if only the statues were okay…{nl}This was all very unexpected.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002331	Thank you. For all your favors.{nl}I think, however... there's something strange here…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002332	I've seen many statues destroyed by demons or broken by monsters…{nl}But none had this awful curse that won't disappear.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002333	I should check the other statues, anyways.{nl}I can move to some extent now, I just pray that the goddess will help me make it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002334	I'm going to rest for a while before I head to Miglos Hill, what about you?{nl}But you don't have to worry about me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002335	Will you?{nl}I'm grateful to have someone as talented as you accompany me, of course!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002336	If you can, go and clear out some monsters on the way to Miglos Hill.{nl}Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002337	I'll follow you once the painkiller takes effect.{nl}I'll meet you at Miglos Hill, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002338	Cuts. And that evil energy…{nl}This owl sculpture is in the same condition as the other.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002339	You would need serious skill to make these cuts.{nl}And to handle such powerful evil energy, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002340	Who could have done this?{nl}Could it be a demon… or someone with other intents?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002341	For now I'll try and purify it.{nl}Will you take care of the other owl sculptures?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002342	Thank you.{nl}You can go to the Raucous Owl Sculpture in Skardus Hill.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002343	We'll have a big problem at hands if that statue is affected by evil energy too…{nl}Good luck.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002344	Raucous Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002345	Did Asel sent you here?{nl}What a relief!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002346	I was worried since none of the other statues are responding; I think they're asleep.{nl}Oh, right… I just remembered something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002347	Not long ago my friends said they saw a strange little girl.{nl}She had an odd energy to her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002348	I think that's when it happened.{nl}I wonder if the girl has anything to do with them being asleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002349	This is going to take a while…{nl}Please take care of the Raucous Owl Sculpture in Skardus Hill.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002350	A girl, you say… I have no idea.{nl}I don't think she would be responsible for this, though.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002351	Maybe the owl sculpture in the training camp knows something.{nl}Meet me at the Grynas Training Camp.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002352	Can my friends ever wake up again?{nl}I want to at least protect them from the monsters… Would you help me just a little bit?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002353	Thank you!{nl}I'll make some crystals that can protect my friends.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002354	A little over Skardus Hill you'll find Spirit Stones.{nl}They're red and sparkly.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002355	Please collect some stones and also ritual pouches used by Stoulets.{nl}I need the powder inside.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002356	Asel can wake them up, right?{nl}I hope the others won't hurt anymore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002357	You got the materials!{nl}I'll use them to make the protective crystals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002358	Finished.{nl}Will you put them next to my friends?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002359	Please put three crystals around each statue.{nl}There's bound to be monsters around so you'll have to clear them out, too.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002360	Luckily I'm here isolated and nothing happened to me.{nl}Who could have done such a thing…?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002361	Thank you.{nl}The crystals will protect my friends for a while so I can put my heart at ease.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002362	You did say that there was evil energy around the cuts on the statues, right?{nl}They must have been bitten by monsters…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002363	Even with the crystals protecting them, wouldn't it be better to get rid of everything harmful?{nl}I'm just worried, you see…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002364	Really? Thank you!{nl}Please clear out some monsters around the statues, then.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002365	Luckily I was left unscathed but…{nl}My friends aren't that vulnerable, who could have done that to them?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002366	Thank you.{nl}I hope my friends wake up soon…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002367	You're here.{nl}This is the place where Dievdirbys have been training since the old days.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002368	Not long ago, however, it was attacked by Sequoia.{nl}The very Sequoia created by Tesla, the one that was taken by evil energies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002369	After they took everyone to a safe place and began to take care of the wounded, this area became empty.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002370	I'll ask the other Dievdirbys about the owl sculptures…{nl}Meanwhile, please have a look at the statue.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002371	If I remember correctly, it will be at the Bevertis Crossroads.{nl}I will see you later.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002372	Hasty Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002373	Help!{nl}I think all my friends are asleep, they're not responding…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002374	Asel is here too?{nl}He must know, then! About the girl, that is.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002375	A girl was here not long ago… She had a really warm energy.{nl}But after meeting with her, all my friends suddenly fell asleep…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002376	You should go see the Lonely Owl Sculpture.{nl}She's on a high spot at the end of a broken path, she could have seen something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002377	We can only hope that the information we need is here.{nl}There are too many things that don't seem right.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002378	Did you find something?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002379	All the owl sculptures that saw the girl are now asleep… Hm.{nl}I'm afraid the Dievdirbys here don't know much, either.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002380	I don't think the girl did anything wrong.{nl}Her energy… it was so warm, you see.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002381	I'll ask the Dievdirbys if any of them saw the girl.{nl}Will you go see the Lonely Owl Sculpture at the broken path?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002382	Lonely Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002383	St-stay away!{nl}Or else I'll…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002384	What? Dievdirbys Asel sent you here?{nl}I was so scared…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002385	A girl… That's odd.{nl}I should investigate a little more.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002386	Oh, that girl… I know about her.{nl}Not long ago I saw a girl being chased by someone around here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002387	It was a man I'd never seen before.{nl}He looked so evil and terrifying... I was really very scared…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002388	That's about the time my friends started to fall asleep.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002389	From up here I can't see that well because of the trees but…{nl}My friends down the road maybe know more than I do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002390	You can follow this path down to Grubus Highway.{nl}I don't know if that statue is asleep though… I'm a little worried.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002391	There was a man chasing the girl?{nl}Then one of them must have put the curse on the owl sculptures.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002392	Now that I think of it, that evil energy would have been difficult to endure for a human…{nl}But we should keep all possibilities open.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002393	The owl sculpture is covered in cuts and… also sleeping.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002394	My friends started to fall asleep not long after I saw that man…{nl}I was really scared then…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002395	The Grubus Highway owl sculpture is also asleep… Hm.{nl}This won't do. We need to do something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002396	Tesla told me about something called a purifying sculpture, but it's complicated…{nl}If I make the sculpture, will you find some materials for the purification?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002397	Fight some Black Old Kepas and get their stems.{nl}Then meet me in front of the Sleeping Owl Sculpture.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002398	You're back faster than I thought.{nl}Just wait a while. This may be complicated but it won't take long.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002399	The only thing is… I don't think I can do this alone in my current state.{nl}I can do the hard part, but you'll have to support me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002400	All you need to do is purify any evil energy with the sculpture.{nl}Meanwhile I'll block the places where the energy is coming from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002401	This is not the time to be talking!{nl}Please, the purification!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002402	I'm sorry. It looks like I failed…{nl}Just what are those cuts…? I need to find another way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002403	I should go see the last training camp owl sculpture.{nl}I'll go first; you follow me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002404	Fortunately... this statue is not asleep because of the curse.{nl}It must be worn out from using too much divine force.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002405	It should be fine if we replenish its power.{nl}I hope this time we can find out something about the cuts…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002406	I'm going to give you an orb and I want you to fill it with the life force of defeated monsters.{nl}With the help of the orb the statue should recover fast.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002407	There are no cuts or evil energy.{nl}But the statue seems fast asleep.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002408	It should be fine if we replenish its power.{nl}I hope this time we can find out something about the cuts…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002409	Good, thank you.{nl}We should be able to wake up the owl sculpture now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002410	Did… Did I fall asleep?{nl}The girl and the man? What happened to them?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002411	So, that day… Yes, that's right.{nl}It was a dark night.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002412	A man I'd never seen was chasing a girl.{nl}I'm sure he was a human, but his energy was like a demon's…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002413	It was really scary.{nl}The girl was right in front of me when the man almost caught her… then, something strange happened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002414	The girl, she…{nl}She used the divine force in me to push the man far away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002415	That's when I lost all my strength and fell asleep…{nl}I don't know what happened next…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002416	It's still all very unclear.{nl}But I think we can assume it wasn't the girl who hurt the statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002417	Still… something doesn't fit.{nl}All the statues said that the man was human…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002418	I doubt that a human could endure such powerful evil energy.{nl}They could be using some sort of unusual method to do it…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002419	Our last hope is the owl sculpture on the Hills.{nl}Meet me there. This time we must get a definitive answer.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002420	I was really scared.{nl}Such an evil energy… I never felt anything like that.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002421	I can't believe it was coming from a human…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002422	Trainee Leryd
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002423	We're not in our best condition right now.{nl}A lot of trainees got hurt during the Sequoia attack.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002424	Still, we can't stop our training, right?{nl}I'm sorry, but could I ask you a small favor?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002425	Thank you!{nl}I want to ask you to collect some items from monsters around this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002426	Everything you can collect will be very useful to us!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002427	I never thought I would one day see the Sequoia with my own two eyes.{nl}And we thought we could put our training to use and face it but…. It was horrible.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002428	You're back already?{nl}Amazing. These will be very useful for our training!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002429	Dievdirbys Ruthalen
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002430	I'm just really upset.{nl}First there was the Sequoia attack, now the Ridimeds are wreaking havoc.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002431	They're very cunning and always move in groups so it's hard to catch them.{nl}I'm sorry, but would you help?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002432	Thank you for helping.{nl}They actually don't show up that easily, so we might need some preparation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002433	I'm talking about a bait, specifically the fruits that Ridimeds like.{nl}I'll stay here and prepare; you can collect the fruits from piles of greenery. They'll have a peculiar scent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002434	Crafting wood, materials…{nl}They'll bite anything they see, even people.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002435	We'll show them right this time.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002436	This should do.{nl}Let's set up the bait for the Ridimeds now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002437	I'll start cooking the fruits over fire like I said.{nl}Please take care of any Ridimeds that show up.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002438	Thank you for your help.{nl}I can feel safe for a while now knowing all the Ridimeds in the area are gone.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002439	Did you happen to see two old carving knives around here?{nl}They're very dear to me, you see…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002440	Oh! That's the knife!{nl}But the other one…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002441	It was a gift from my parents, I really can't lose it…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002442	If you find that knife, please return it to me.{nl}My name will be carved on the handle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002443	Yes! That's my knife!{nl}Thank you for bringing my precious knife back to me. Thank you!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002444	Dievdirbys Aisol
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002445	Oh, Asel told me about you.{nl}He is really impressed with your talent.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002446	Things are a bit rough here because of the Sequoia attack.{nl}If that's okay, I would like to ask for your help… What do you say?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002447	Wow, thank you.{nl}What happened here was… well, the Sequoia attacked our training camp.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002448	Did you know?{nl}The Sequoia was created by Tesla, the Dievdirbys Master, to protect the owl sculptures.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002449	But it was corrupted by the evil energy at Karolis Springs.{nl}This all happened a long time ago…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002450	Now the Sequoia came with other monsters and started to wreak havoc here.{nl}And… that's about it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002451	First I'll ask you to clear out some monsters around here.{nl}They came with the Sequoia and are very persistent.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002452	We don't know why the Sequoia became like this…{nl}But its evil energy looks extremely powerful.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002453	But that happened a long time ago; now the owl sculptures…{nl}I don't know. Their case looks similar, but why would this happen after such a long time?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002454	Wow… You did a great job!{nl}Now we only need to deal with the Sequoia.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002455	The Sequoia is still lurking around here.{nl}But after the last attack, I don't think we can fight that soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002456	The truth is, we feel sorry for asking you this favor.{nl}The Sequoia is extremely dangerous. We understand if you want to refuse.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002457	Will you… be okay?{nl}The last place we saw the Sequoia was near the broken path.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002458	Hm… Right. It's still wounded from the previous attack so…{nl}Someone like you can definitely take it down. I'll wish you good luck!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002459	If it gets close to you, run away.{nl}We tried ambushing it and even then it was extremely brutal and resilient.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002460	Just try and stay safe…{nl}Do you think you can do it?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002461	You did it!{nl}You defeated the Sequoia… I am in awe, really.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002462	We can finally recover in peace now.{nl}Thank you so much for all your help!
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002463	Now. We hould check to see if the owl sculptures are still asleep.{nl}Let's split so we can check faster.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002464	I'll go see the owl sculpture in Siauras Valley.{nl}Please have a look at the Quiet Owl Sculpture at Susipyne Hill.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002465	Thank you.{nl}Meet me at Siauras Valley again when you're done checking.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002466	Quiet Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002467	You have divine energy in you.{nl}I heard a girl like you was here a few days ago…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002468	You want to know about the girl and a suspicious man?{nl}I don't know. I didn't see anything… I just heard about it from the other statues.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002469	I was worried since they all seemed to have fallen asleep.{nl}Did they see something they shouldn't?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002470	If Asel is here, that must be why they woke up, right?{nl}Although I'm sorry I can't be of more use to you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002471	Let's check the statues and meet at Siauras Valley again.{nl}Hopefully with good news.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002472	The sleeping owl sculptures should know?{nl}Hm… I'm sure it was that suspicious man.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002473	The way he moves is a lot like an assassin.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002474	Fortunately the statue I saw wasn't as affected by the curse.{nl}So I was able to talk to it a little bit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002475	It seems the girl was chased by the suspicious man all the way here…{nl}Then she tried to use the power of the owl sculptures to keep him away.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002476	After that she headed to the Laukimo Vacant Lot.{nl}We should go there too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002477	It's tragic… The owl sculptures…{nl}Not even I can help them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002478	There's something here. Inside the lot, that is.{nl}But the evil energy is too strong… My body can't take it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002479	You don't seem to be affected, though.{nl}It could be the Purifying Sculpture protecting you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002480	I think you can go inside the vacant lot.{nl}Please… go and see where this evil energy is coming from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002481	Sorry.{nl}I wish I could follow you but I can't move any further…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002482	I can't take it much longer…{nl}Please hurry…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002483	What's this… a dagger and a broken amulet.{nl}I need to have a look at these.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002484	I'm not sure but I feel traces of a special protection spell on this amulet.{nl}The dagger just gives off a powerful evil energy…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002485	Right. With this amulet, you wouldn't have to be a demon to use the dagger.{nl}But for some reason the amulet broke… and they abandoned both objects here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002486	With an evil energy this strong, I don't think even the Purifying Sculpture can help.{nl}We may need to call Tesla.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002487	I feel so sorry for the owl sculptures inside…{nl}We can only try and stop such a thing from happening again…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002488	Hm… If even Asel can't handle this energy…{nl}There's not much the Purifying Sculpture can do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002489	I'll carve another sculpture just in case.{nl}Please wait.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002490	I don't how much longer I can take it, please hurry…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002491	If the evil energy is too powerful, the Purifying Sculpture alone won't be able to stop it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002492	Here. Take this.{nl}It will help the Purifying Sculpture.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002493	Are you saying Tesla created a new sculpture?{nl}Hm… This method is… Clearly I still need to train more…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002494	Now. The dagger is one thing, but the vacant lot is full of evil energy too.{nl}Go there. Get rid of the evil energy all at once.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002495	I reckon this sculpture will do.{nl}I hope Asel won't be too hard on himself…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002496	Tesla's sculpture is impressive.{nl}I can already feel the evil energy disappear…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002497	Now. I'll prepare for the dagger purification.{nl}Will you collect the Yellow Griba Pollen?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002498	Thank you.{nl}I'll start the procedure as soon as you come back.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002499	Using the Purifying and Suppressing Sculptures together will work for sure.{nl}This time we'll definitely get to the end of it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002500	Thank you.{nl}This should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002501	Okay. I'll start the purification procedure now.{nl}The clash of divine and evil energies is going to attract monsters.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002502	I'll leave the monsters up to you.{nl}Please take care of them while I finish the procedure.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002503	It's a success!{nl}I've erradicated the evil energy…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002504	Not everything is back to normal, though.{nl}The owl sculptures are still asleep.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002505	We also need to find out the one responsible for this…{nl}And the girl.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002506	There is one owl sculpture left.{nl}Its name is Friendly Owl Sculpture… it lives on the Stabdymo Shore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002507	I wonder if it knows the whereabouts of the girl or the suspicious man.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002508	I'm… so sorry.{nl}I really need to rest. Using so much divine force has tired me…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002509	I trust you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002510	A girl and a suspicious man?{nl}No one's been here in a while.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002511	Hm… Come to think about it, I did see a pillar of light coming from the lot a few days ago.{nl}I'm not sure if that's related or not.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002512	The statues at the Laukimo Vacant Lot should know…{nl}Why don't you go there?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002513	Oh… That's why they weren't responding…{nl}Who could have done it…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002514	We can't let this happen again.{nl}There is a way to look into their memories, at least part of them.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002515	Go and ask Asel to carve another owl sculpture.{nl}I'll impart some of my power onto it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002516	That should allow me to peek into the others' memories.{nl}And don't forget to purify any evil energy first.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002517	Looking into the memories of the owl sculptures…{nl}I see. So there is a way!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002518	I can make a small owl sculpture, no problem.{nl}The purification is going to be a little harder, though…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002519	Here's the statue. Please take it.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002520	The problem is me.{nl}The divine power I used to purify the dagger hasn't recovered yet…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002521	There's no other way. I'll carve the statue.{nl}Meanwhile, I'm sorry but I'm going to ask you to fill this orb with life force again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002522	I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002523	If only I hadn't been attacked by monsters before I met you…{nl}I'm a digrace.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002524	You're back already!{nl}Give me the statue.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002525	I'll impart some of our power onto it.{nl}After you take it, you'll be able to see some of our memories.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002526	I guess… I'll never see my friends again.{nl}I hopes this at least helps those who survived.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002527	In all my life I had never seen something so mystical.{nl}I wonder what the mysterious power is…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002528	In the end we still don't know who the two men are.{nl}But considering the power of their evil energy… Someone so strong is surely well-known.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002529	And thank you for everything.{nl}If it weren't for you, the owls here would be asleep forever without knowing what happened.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002530	I'm going to investigate this issue a bit further.{nl}May the grace of the goddess bless your way.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002531	The… the broken statues.{nl}They must have been bitten by monsters with evil energy, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002532	I heard the monsters were attacking owls in other forests…{nl}I'm scared that will happen here too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002533	Would you clear out some monsters around here?{nl}I know it's not a definitive solution, but it would make me feel safer…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002534	I used to feel safe with all the Dievdirbys around…{nl}Now I'm really worried for the future.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002535	Thank you!{nl}I sure hope you and the Dievdirbys find a solution soon…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002536	I have a favor to ask you.{nl}It seems like the spirits aren't following me anymore.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002537	It's all because of the Sequoia.{nl}I think the spirits are too scared…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002538	I need to guide the spirits before the demons get them…{nl}Would you help me with that?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002539	First, collect some Green Sakmoli leaves.{nl}Their scent comforts the hearts of the spirits.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002540	The Sequoia… Maybe the spirits were too afraid of it.{nl}But if they don't return to the goddess, even scarier things will happen…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002541	This should be enough.{nl}Let's try and guide the spirits now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002542	If you see a wandering spirit, burn the leaves.{nl}Their scent will attract the spirits to you, so you can guide them to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002543	Please take good care of the spirits.{nl}Make sure they find their way to me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002544	Someone once said birth and conclusion are the values remembered in life.{nl}That's why I want to send the spirits to the goddess in safety. Thank you for helping.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002545	When will my friends wake up…?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002546	A lot of people were wounded in the attack and a lot of our things were destroyed, too.{nl}It's a disgrace...
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002547	Many souls were startled by the Sequoia and lost their way…{nl}But if they don't return to the goddess, scarier things are going happen…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002548	The sleeping owl sculptures should know something.{nl}Asel can wake them up, right?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002549	It's awfully quiet now that most of my friends are asleep…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002550	So. The statue is finished and the orb is ready.{nl}With the power from this orb, purification should be quick.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002551	Go and take some power from the Friendly Owl Sculpture.{nl}Let's carry on with the purification.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002552	I'm worried. What happened…?{nl}My friends suddenly fell asleep…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002553	It looks like someone is fighting.{nl}What's happening?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002554	Loremaster Daroul
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002555	Thank you for helping me!{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002556	Those monsters were more dangeours than I expected…{nl}Lucky you could defeat them so easily, traveler.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002557	Oh, I didn't introduce myself.{nl}My name is Daroul, I'm a loremaster serving Goddess Jurate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002558	Maybe… you don't what we do exactly.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002559	Feel free to ask me anything.{nl}There's probably a lot that you don't know.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002560	Did I satisfy your curiosity?{nl}Unfortunately Goddess Jurate seems to have been mostly forgotten… It's a shame.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002561	I just wish that Goddess Jurate would answer us for a moment.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002562	We heard the sea had turned into land and came as fast as we could…{nl}We had to prepare everything by ourselves.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002563	One of our members is looking for a place to build an altar…{nl}Me, I'm preparing an offering for the goddess, but we're very short-handed, you see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002564	So please.{nl}Think of this as your destiny chosen by the goddess and give us a hand?{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002565	Thank you.{nl}First, you could go to the Lamdonas Coral Reef and find some blue corals.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002566	Our other member came while you where collecting the corals.{nl}They found a spot with concentrated sea energy and are going to build the altar there, they said.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002567	I'm going to go help them; will you come along?{nl}If the ceremony is successful, we might just see Goddess Jurate again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002568	I feel reassured now.{nl}They said the energy is concentrated at the Dellam Sandbank; come see me there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002569	Loremaster Berta
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002570	Oh, hello!{nl}You're the one who helped brother Daroul.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002571	These are just what we need!{nl}They're in good condition, too.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002572	They'll make a wonderful offering for the goddess.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002573	We need the blue corals found at the Lamdonas Coral Reef.{nl}The area has a lot of monsters though, so be careful…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002574	It looks like a normal stone. Let me try the holy water.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002575	We need the altar back as soon as possible…{nl}But the sea energy seems to have made the Crabil even more powerful.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002576	Thank you for helping with our ceremony for Goddess Jurate.{nl}Other loremasters should start gathering here soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002577	I believe that someday Goddess Jurate will once again hear our prayers.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002578	Thanks to you we managed to speed things up.{nl}We should hurry and finish building the altar now.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002579	Our offering ceremony to the goddess was possible all thanks to you.{nl}I don't know what we would do if it were just me and Berta…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002580	I pray that the goddess will once again look over us soon.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002581	The altar is damaged, and the offerings are completely ruined.{nl}We need to hurry and prepare everything again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002582	It's hard for me to move because of the wounds…{nl}But I need to have a look at the owl sculptures…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002583	I'll trust you with the coral.{nl}Joana will do a much better job at crafting it than me.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002584	Sigh… Looks like the Ridimeds messed with the dry wood again.{nl}I even threw away all the wood I had stored because of the Sequoia; I don't know what to do…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002585	A lot of people were wounded in the attack and a lot of our things were destroyed, too.{nl}I need to look for my missing knife if things settle.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002586	Thank you for defeating the Crabil.{nl}Thanks to you we can now carry on with the ceremony.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002587	Thank you for finding my knife.{nl}Now I can really focus on my work.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002588	Did you get the handicraft from Joana?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002589	What a beautiful piece.{nl}Incredible handicraft work…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002590	Thank you.{nl}I think the goddess will be very pleased with this offering.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002591	A few days ago the Sequoia and the monsters decided to wreak havoc here.{nl}Most of our group fled to a safe place, the rest are here dealing with the damage.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002592	Thanks to you we can focus on getting back on our feet.{nl}We need to get everything ready so the trainees can start practicing again.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002593	Apart from the statue on the Broken Path, no one else is reponding…{nl}What could have happened to the others?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002594	What could have happened to the others…?{nl}And who is that evil man…?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002595	Thank you for helping.{nl}As soon as things settle here we need to take care of those Ridimeds.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002596	Who was that man surrounded by evil energy?{nl}And what could have happened to the girl he was chasing?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002597	It's getting so quiet here.{nl}My friends all fell asleep, one by one…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002598	Exhausted Owl Sculpture
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002599	The girl came running to me and I felt an unexplicable warmth in her...{nl}Then the girl used my power to chase away the suspicious man…{nl}
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002600	I might have let her borrow too much of my power… I fell asleep right away.{nl}What happened to her?
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002601	The forest feels awfully quiet today, now that most of my friends are asleep…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002602	I sure hope nothing like this ever happens again.{nl}I don't want to lose my friends…
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002603	Let's go back to Dievdirbys Asel first and talk about this.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002604	Let's look for the statue at the Grubus Highway like the Lonely Owl Sculpture said.
QUEST_LV_0300_20160718_002605	Follow Dievdirbys Asel to the Grynas Hills!
